# Contributing to VOID-SPACE WIKI

**The naming keeps Fantasia alive. Every score, every page, every correction is a name given.**

This wiki is a community-maintained record of the VOID-SPACE world — its physics, figures, enemies, campaigns, and lore. The underlying framework (Pe, void conditions, drift cascade) is grounded in published, peer-reviewed research. The world built on top of it is yours to expand.

## What's Seeded Canon vs. What's Open

| Layer | What | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Layer 0 — Physics** | Pe, void conditions, O/R/C dimensions, drift cascade math | **Locked. Do not rewrite. Link to [moreright.xyz](https://moreright.xyz) for corrections.** |
| **Layer 1 — Cosmological canon** | The Current, The Corona, Hand of Fantasia (ALEPH/MIRU/KIRU/XENIA/KAIROS), Godhand Five, Fantasia Bound, Above/Below | **Locked.** Corrections welcome, expansions via PR. |
| **Layer 2 — World lore** | Campaigns, named figures (Samael, Ratio, Ox-32, The Recorder), city districts, factions | **Open for expansion** with custodian review. |
| **Layer 3 — Community content** | New NPCs, campaign footnotes, in-world artifacts, Drift-Encoded variants, fan lore consistent with Layer 0 | **Fully open.** Correct format → merge. |

**Rule:** Layer 0 is not opinion. If your contribution contradicts the framework physics, it will not be merged — not because it's wrong creatively, but because the physics is empirically grounded. Read [the framework](https://moreright.xyz/pages/framework.html) first.

## Drift Encoding — Write in the World's Language

Entities operating at high Pe appear with corrupted names in this wiki. This is not a typo — it is the **Drift Rendering System**: names corrupt as The Current rises.

| Pe level | What you see | What it means |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Pe < 1.0 | `FEMTO` | Clear. Grounded. |
| Pe 1.0–2.5 | `FᛖMᛏO` | Diacritical interference. The void is present. |
| Pe 2.5–4.0 | `ᚠᛖᛗᛏᛟ` | Partial runic substitution. D2 threshold. |
| Pe ≥ 4.0 | `ᚠ̷ᛖ̴ᛗ̸ᛏ̵ᛟ̶` | Full corruption. Pandemonium. Requires **True Read** to decode. |

Community contributors may write lore entries **in Drift-Encoded form** for high-Pe entities. The encoding table and implementation spec are in [`mechanics/drift-encoding.md`](docs/mechanics/drift-encoding.md).

Encoding your lore in the world's own language is not just aesthetic — it signals Pe level to readers and is itself a game mechanic.

## How to Contribute

### Quick edits
Every page has an **"Edit this page"** button (pencil icon, top right). Click it → edit in GitHub → propose changes.

### Larger contributions
1. Fork [`MoreRightDAO/VOID-SPACE-WIKI`](https://github.com/MoreRightDAO/VOID-SPACE-WIKI)
2. Create a branch (`lore/your-topic` or `fix/page-name`)
3. Edit or add markdown files in `docs/`
4. Open a pull request with a brief description
5. Custodian reviews, requests changes if needed, merges

### What gets merged
- Consistent with Layer 0 physics
- Consistent with Layer 1 canon (no contradictions to locked figures/mechanics)
- Markdown valid, follows existing page structure
- No external IP reuse (see below)

### What doesn't
- Content that contradicts Pe/void framework math
- Copyrighted text, artwork, or character designs reproduced without transformation
- Speculation presented as canon (mark fan theory as fan theory)
- Doxxing, harassment, real-person targeting

## IP and Fair Use

This wiki operates on the **same principle as the framework itself**: naming must be legible, grounded, and transparent.

The VOID-SPACE world uses structural analogies to existing fiction (anime, games, myth) as **mechanical references**, not as reproduced content. The four reference worlds (Fantasia, Zeal, NERV, Berserk) are mapped to framework physics — they are cited, not cloned.

**For contributors:**
- You may write lore that draws on real mythology (Norse, Greek, Celtic, Babylonian, Hermetic) — all public domain
- You may write structural analogies to existing fiction without reproducing copyrighted content
- You may not reproduce character designs, dialogue, or narrative sequences from copyrighted works
- When in doubt: your original character inspired by an archetype is fine. Copying a character is not.

The custodian will not merge content that poses IP risk to the project.

## Community Standards

VOID-SPACE is a game about naming extraction architecture in the real world. The community should embody the constraint it scores:

- **Low opacity:** say what you mean, credit your sources, show your reasoning
- **Invariant:** your scoring discipline doesn't change based on who owns the platform
- **Independent:** no external pressure changes what the math says

The wiki is the lore layer of a live scoring operation. Treat it accordingly.
