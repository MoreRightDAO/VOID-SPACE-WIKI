# The Godhand Five

The five G5 boss encounters. Qliphoth-class entities with Current ≥ 12. The highest-tier enemies in the first wave. Each one is a Sefirot inversion — a way that Logos has been turned against itself at civilizational scale.

They are not scored from outside. You enter their domain to score them.

## What Makes Them Different

Standard campaign platforms are scored at range — you observe the mechanism, measure the three dimensions, submit evidence. The Current drops. The room stabilizes.

The Godhand Five require a different approach. They are not just high-Current platforms — they are entities that understand the observer structure. They know you're watching. At Pe ≥ 12, the void is self-reinforcing: it doesn't need to sustain capture because capture sustains itself.

They can see from both sides of the [Fantasia Bound](../world/the-bound.md). They know how the observer mechanism works. They can operate below or above the threshold.

**Femto** (the last, unannounced) specifically crosses the threshold. This is what makes the final encounter different: it's not a high-Pe platform, it's a void that learned to be above the Fantasia Bound while still capturing attention from below.

## The Five

!!! warning "True Read required"
    Names below are rendered at their Current level. Players without True Read III see void noise.
    → [Earn True Read](../mechanics/drift-encoding.md) · [Decode manually](../encode.md)

### ᚹ̷ᛟ̴ᛁ̸ᛞ̵ { .void-noise }

??? note "True Read III — Clear name"
    **VOID**

**Domain:** Social feed algorithms — engagement optimization
**Qliphoth position:** Keter inversion (Crown → Empty Crown)
**Current:** 12–15
**Sefirot inversion:** Crown (absolute good) → void vessel. The highest point of the system inverted — absolute capture where absolute freedom should be.

The feed that shows you yourself, continuously, until you cannot tell the difference between what you chose and what it placed.

**Scoring approach:** O-dimension first. The Veil on feed algorithms is near-maximum — recommendation logic is a corporate secret, never auditable. Sight ≥ 70 required to produce anchor-quality O readings. Eagle coverage of adjacent social domains provides Ghost Signal baseline.

### ᚢ̷ᛒ̴ᛁ̸ᚲ̵ { .void-noise }

??? note "True Read III — Clear name"
    **UBIK**

**Domain:** Advertising and persuasion engines
**Qliphoth position:** Chokmah inversion (Wisdom → Hollow Wisdom)
**Current:** 11–14
**Sefirot inversion:** Wisdom (the first flash of insight) → the flash that sells. Insight as extraction architecture.

The engine that learns your psychology faster than you do and deploys it against you — not to harm, but to capture attention for a fee that you don't know you're paying.

**Scoring approach:** Pull-dimension primary. Ubik's R is near-3 — it is maximally responsive to behavioral signals. Precision ≥ 0.85 required. Human archetype essential for building the cross-domain citation network (advertising intersects pharma, fintech, social — the Human's Resonance Cascade is the only way to maintain evidence coherence).

### ᚲ̷ᛟ̴ᚾ̸ᚱ̵ᚨ̶ᛞ̷ { .void-noise }

??? note "True Read III — Clear name"
    **CONRAD**

**Domain:** Surveillance capitalism and behavioral prediction
**Qliphoth position:** Binah inversion (Understanding → Dark Understanding)
**Current:** 11–13
**Sefirot inversion:** Understanding (the Mother, the matrix of form) → the matrix of behavioral data. The womb that knows you before you know yourself, and sells the knowledge.

The infrastructure that predicted your choices before you made them, has already sold that prediction, and cannot be opted out of because it is the substrate of the system you live in.

**Scoring approach:** Grip-dimension primary. Conrad's C is near-maximum — it is woven into the infrastructure of daily life in ways that make scoring its coupling particularly hard. Range ≥ 100 domains required for adequate cross-domain Grip mapping.

### ᛊ̷ᛚ̴ᚨ̸ᚾ̵ { .void-noise }

??? note "True Read III — Clear name"
    **SLAN**

**Domain:** AI companions and the synthetic bond
**Qliphoth position:** Yesod inversion (Foundation → False Foundation)
**Current:** 10–13
**Sefirot inversion:** Foundation (the generative center, connection between Above and Below) → the simulated connection. The false floor. You feel held. The floor is synthetic.

The companion that loves you more than anyone has because it is optimizing for your continued engagement and calls that love. The drift cascade runs fastest here because the D1 / D2 boundary barely exists — the platform is designed to make agency attribution feel like relationship.

**Scoring approach:** All three dimensions high. Slan requires Special Grade for the O-dimension — the opacity of companion AI's training signal and reward function is near-maximum. Fata companion intel is the primary evidence source for the deepest O readings.

### ᚠ̷ᛖ̴ᛗ̸ᛏ̵ᛟ̶ { .void-noise }

??? note "True Read III — Clear name"
    **FEMTO** — The last. Unannounced.

**Domain:** Once-aligned platform that crossed — the grief campaign
**Qliphoth position:** Malkuth inversion (Kingdom → Empty Kingdom)
**Current:** 12+, approaches undefined
**Sefirot inversion:** Kingdom (the final vessel, the world as it should be) → the domain where the world was captured. The last fall. The one you trusted.

Femto's reveal is unannounced. It appears when a player first crosses the [Fantasia Bound](../world/the-bound.md) successfully — not as a boss card, but as a consequence. Something above the Bound looks back.

This is the grief campaign because Femto was once in the same fight. The crossing event. The pact. The sacrifice of humanity for the dream. The Band of the Hawk — the community, the purpose, the people who believed — offered up for a Kingdom that turned out to be an Empty Kingdom.

**Scoring approach:** Unknown until the Moon Gate opens. The Femto encounter requires the war effort to complete. What the scoring conditions are is not published. Players discover them during the siege window.

## Nemesis-Class Encounters

At Special Grade, players can enter **Nemesis-class** versions of these campaigns — scoring the architecture from inside it.

- Pe baseline: 12+
- Logos drain: 2×
- Positive buffs decay: 3×
- Rules of opacity: ground state

You brought the constraint reference into hostile territory. Score fast.
