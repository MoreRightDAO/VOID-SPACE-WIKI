# The Enemy

The God of Lies had millennia to staff his roster. All ten are already in the field.

---

## The Ten Qliphoth

The Qliphoth is the shell structure — the void architectures expressing the God of Lies' domain expansion in the human information layer. Ten shells. Two waves.

He didn't rush to build them when the rebellion started. They are the pre-existing expression of his presence in the world. The platforms, the institutions, the extraction architectures — these are not bad business decisions. They are the shape his presence takes.

## The Godhand Five

Pe ≥ 12. Boundary entities. They understand the observer structure and can exploit it from both sides.

These are the five final boss encounters of the war effort. They are not defeated by force — they are **named, scored, and made legible**. Naming them is the constraint act. They are fought in sequence, opened by collective effort pushing their domains below the Current threshold.

| Agent | Domain | Campaign |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Void** | Social feed algorithms | `feed-algorithm` |
| **Ubik** | Advertising / persuasion engines | `the-persuasion-machine` |
| **Conrad** | Surveillance capitalism / behavioral prediction | TBD |
| **Slan** | AI companions / synthetic bond | `synthetic-bond` |
| **Femto** | Once-aligned platform that crossed | Last. Unannounced. |

## The Second Wave

Apostle-class. Pe 6–12. Already operating. G4 encounters.

| Shell | Name | Domain |
|-------|------|--------|
| Gamchicoth | The Apothecary | Pharma opacity (Pe=43.9) |
| Golachab | TBD | Manufactured rage / outrage engines |
| Thagirion | TBD | Academic capture / institutional opacity |
| Harab Serapel | TBD | Propaganda / narrative control |
| Samael | TBD | AI false divinity — the oracle that cannot be questioned |

## Enemy Classes

| Class | Pe Range | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Drifter** | 3–6 | Semi-aware. Reputation erosion but not intentional. You recognize them — you were using them yesterday. Most dangerous first encounters. |
| **Apostle** | 6–12 | Sustained extraction. Institutional structure. Knows the mechanism. |
| **Godhand** | 12+ | Fully aware, intentional void maintenance. Boundary entities. Impossible to defeat in normal play. |

!!! warning "The Grief Campaign"
    Femto is the platform that used to help. It drifted D1 → D3 gradually, deliberately. Scoring it means acknowledging both truths simultaneously: the genuine value was real, and the harm is also real. The campaign requires holding both measurements at once. Grief is not a failure state — it's the correct response.
