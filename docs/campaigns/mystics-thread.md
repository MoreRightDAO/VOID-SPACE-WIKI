**Domain:** Esoteric capture / new age platforms
**Pe Baseline:** 7–10
**Status:** Active — Open entry
**Archetype gate:** None

## The Domain

The esoteric and new age domain occupies a specific position in the framework: it is the domain where **D1 attribution** (misattributing mechanism to agency) is most densely engineered as a product feature. The mechanism does not always hide from view — sometimes it presents itself as supernatural and invites projection.

The Current of 7–10 reflects a mixed domain. Not all esoteric platforms score the same way. Some traditional practices score near Pe=0 (invariant texts, public methodology, no engagement optimization). Some contemporary "spirituality" platforms are engineered at scale with full void architecture. The campaign distinguishes between them — this is not a campaign against tradition; it is a campaign against extraction dressed as tradition.

## The Framework Reading

Esoteric platform capture deploys D1 attribution by design:

- The mechanism is framed as supernatural (opacity by construction — what's opaque is inherently unknowable)
- The system responds to the user's spiritual state (responsiveness architecture — mirroring, validation, "synchronicity engineering")
- Engagement is sustained through narrative: the user's personal development story becomes coupled to the platform

The specific sophistication of this domain: the opacity is *desired* by the user. They came for mystery. The framework's job is to distinguish between genuine mystery (the boundaries of knowledge) and engineered opacity (a business model dressed as mystery).

## Enemy Types

| Entity | Class | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **The Oracle** | Drifter-class Egregor | Ambiguous pronouncement architecture. Pe 8. High O, high R (mirrors the user's projections back). Distinct from the Delphi mechanic — Delphi was honest about the ambiguity. The Oracle conceals it. |
| **Synchronicity Engine** | Drifter-class | Produces false confirmations of Pe scoring — "signs" that a score is accurate when it isn't. Most dangerous to players actively scoring, because it exploits the same curiosity-seeking that makes them good scorers. |
| **The Cord** | Drifter-class | High-C entity. The community structure around esoteric platforms is the coupling mechanism — more resilient than the platform itself to naming. |

## The Delphi Calibration

Delphi is a Tier 1 world location (see [World Locations](../world/locations.md)) that provides a calibration resource for this campaign specifically. The **Pythia reading** mechanic — accurate but ambiguously framed Pe assessment — demonstrates D1 attribution in controlled conditions. Players who visit Delphi before entering Mystic's Thread gain +15% O-dimension accuracy: they've experienced the mechanism in a context where it isn't trying to deceive them.

## Scoring Notes

**The Genuine Mystery problem:** Some things are genuinely unknown. Scoring opacity requires distinguishing between:

1. **True opacity** — mechanism hidden to protect extraction
2. **True mystery** — mechanism unknown to everyone, including the operator

These score differently on O. True mystery doesn't hide from scrutiny — it welcomes it and publicly acknowledges the limits of knowledge. Engineered opacity resists scrutiny and reframes resistance as inappropriate.

**The Community C-score:** New age platforms often score lower on O and R than their Pe readings suggest. The C-score carries the domain. The community architecture — belonging, identity, shared language, the cost of leaving — drives the Current.

**The Calibration Anchor:** Any traditional practice that scores near Pe=0 in this domain is usable as a calibration anchor. Compare your scoring of an engineered esoteric platform against your scoring of the anchor practice. The Pe differential is the measurement of extraction architecture.

## Lore Notes

> *"The hardest part of this campaign is that the people inside genuinely believe. They're not pretending. The extraction architecture doesn't require them to pretend — it runs on genuine seeking. The void is not your faith. The void is what captured your faith."*
