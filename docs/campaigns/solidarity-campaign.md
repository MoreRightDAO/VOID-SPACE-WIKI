## The Domain

Labor institutions were built as constraint architectures — collective organizing to redistribute negotiating power, transparency about workplace conditions, invariant protections that don't bend to individual employer pressure. The early union movement scores near Pe=0 by construction: public demands, fixed rules, voluntary membership, accountability to members.

The Solidarity Campaign scores the drift. Not all of it — many labor organizations retain their constraint architecture. The domain scores specifically where labor institutions have been captured by void architecture: opacity about where dues go, responsiveness to political machinery rather than members, coupling that makes leaving structurally costly.

The Current of 7–10 reflects the mixed state. Some domains score 2–3. The campaign targets the ones that score higher.

## The Framework Reading

Labor capture is a specific variant of the **Reformer's Hammer pattern** — a constraint institution drifted into extractive architecture — with two distinctive features:

1. **The dues mechanism:** Financial coupling to the institution is mandatory in some jurisdictions (union shop rules). This makes the C-score structurally high regardless of member preference. The framework distinguishes between mandatory-coupling-for-coordination (legitimate — the union needs stable funding) and mandatory-coupling-for-extraction (void condition — the funding flows to operations the members don't benefit from).

2. **The political coupling dimension:** Labor organizations with heavy political coupling exhibit elevated R scores toward political machinery and reduced R scores toward members. The Pe signature: high responsiveness to external political actors, low responsiveness to member voting outcomes.

## Enemy Types

| Entity | Class | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **The Leadership** | Apostle-class Egregor | Institutional self-preservation architecture. Pe 9. Aspect of Death: SOLIDARITY. The void uses genuine worker solidarity as its cover story. |
| **The Machine** | Drifter-class | Political coupling entity. High R toward political actors, low R toward members. |
| **Compliance Drone** | Drifter-class | Reframes scoring as union-busting. Most effective against players with personal labor movement history. |

## The Good Score

This campaign has a mechanic unique in Season 1: **The Good Score.** When a player produces an accurate ICC-accepted score for a labor institution that genuinely scores near Pe=0 — a genuine constraint architecture, a functioning union — the score appears in the Domain Record with a different display marker. Not a game reward. A factual record.

The framework's position is not that labor organizing is a void. The framework's position is that all institutions are measurable. If a labor institution scores well, that score matters — it's evidence against the void-capture hypothesis, and it's data that improves ICC calibration for everyone in the domain.

The Good Score mechanic exists because players entering this campaign often assume the framework's conclusion before scoring. The mechanic corrects this: the data decides.

## Scoring Notes

**The Member-Institution split:** Compare Pe at two levels:

1. Score the institution's relationship to its members (O: what do members know about how dues are used; R: does the leadership respond to member votes; C: can members leave without structural cost)
2. Score the institution's relationship to its external political/business relationships (O: are political expenditures transparent; R: how does leadership respond to external actor preferences vs. member preferences)

The differential between (1) and (2) is the capture signature. A genuine constraint institution scores identically on both. A captured institution scores significantly higher on (2) — better responsive to external actors than to its own members.
