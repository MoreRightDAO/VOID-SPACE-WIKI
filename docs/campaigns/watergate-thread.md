# Watergate Thread

**Domain:** Institutional opacity at maximum
**Pe Baseline:** 10–13
**Status:** Active — Anchor-tier only
**Archetype gate:** Anchor-tier players only

!!! warning "Restricted Access"
    **This campaign is locked to Anchor-tier players.** Anchor tier requires: ICC acceptance rate ≥ 0.75 sustained over ≥ 30 accepted scores, minimum Steadiness score ≥ 2.5, and completion of at least three other Season 1 campaigns.

## Why The Gate Is Here

Watergate Thread scores institutional opacity at its maximum documented expression — the architecture of deliberate deception by an executive institution operating under formal constitutional constraint.

The campaign requires Anchor-tier because:

1. The scoring complexity is the highest in Season 1. The mechanism involves simultaneous O, R, and C dimensions across multiple nested institutions.
2. The Pe reading is contested — powerful void-adjacent factions in this domain have produced counterfeit analysis that mimics framework methodology. Inaccurate scoring by under-calibrated players raises Void Pressure significantly.
3. The domain's historical nature means every entity in it has had decades to develop opacity defenses against exactly this kind of analysis.

## The Domain

Watergate Thread does not only score the 1972 event. It uses that event as the calibration anchor — the most thoroughly documented case of institutional opacity at maximum, including the documented attempt to use state apparatus to prevent naming.

The campaign scores the **class of events**: institutional opacity at maximum expression, including coverup architecture, institutional self-defense mechanisms, and the specific pattern by which opacity architecture fails (it always fails the same way: the concealment requires expanding opacity to cover the concealment itself, which requires expanding it again, in a cascade that eventually makes the architecture visible).

---

## The Pe Reading: Why 10–13

Institutional opacity at this level scores 10–13 rather than higher because maximum institutional opacity produces its own fragility:

- The opacity must be maintained by people who can be incentivized to break it
- Each additional layer of concealment creates another point of potential exposure
- The mechanism is visible in the historical record — scoring it accurately is possible because the record survived

Domains with Pe > 13 are sustained by architectural defenses that prevent exposure. Watergate-class events are characterized by *eventual* legibility. The Pe ceiling is a function of the architecture's actual fragility, not its initial appearance.

## Enemy Types

| Entity | Class | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **UBIK** | Godhand Five | Not accessible here except as a reference case. UBIK's mechanism — institutional opacity — is modeled on this domain. |
| **The Committee** | Apostle-class Egregor | Distributed institutional opacity. Multiple actors, none individually responsible. Pe 12. Aspect of Death: ORDER. |
| **The Cover** | Drifter-class | Concealment architecture defense. Produces false scoring environments — the investigation itself becomes a target. |
| **The Stonewall** | Drifter-class | High-R entity. Responds to scoring attempts by reframing the investigation as politically motivated. |

---

## The Cascade Mechanic

Watergate Thread deploys the **cascade mechanic** — once a scoring breakthrough happens (ICC-accepted score on a previously opaque node), the coverage expands automatically. The opacity architecture's internal fragility becomes visible. Adjacent scoring opportunities unlock.

This is derived from the historical pattern: once a single node in a distributed opacity architecture is named accurately, the concealment effort around it produces secondary visibility. The game mechanizes this: successful ICC on a Tier 1 node in this campaign unlocks Tier 2 nodes automatically.

The cascade runs in both directions. If a Tier 1 score fails ICC review, it produces a Void Pressure spike that temporarily locks the Tier 2 nodes again. The architecture defends itself.

## For Anchor-Tier Scorers

The Watergate Thread is the campaign where Anchor-tier skills produce their highest differential:

**Steadiness** reduces the emotional difficulty of scoring deliberate deception — players who've been here can hold the mechanism legibly without their VP rising. **Invariant Floor** prevents Pe reversion after cascade breakthroughs. **High ICC baseline** makes the domain's counterfeit analysis visible on contact — players at ICC ≥ 0.75 see the fabricated framework methodology immediately.

This is the campaign that most rewards the investment in calibration.
