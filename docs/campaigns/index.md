# Campaigns

Campaigns are the primary game loop. Each campaign is a real domain — a class of platforms or systems with a measurable Current — turned into a scored encounter.

You are not clearing fictional dungeons. You are measuring real extraction architectures. The scoring is live. The Current drops are real. The papers that resulted from this work are published with DOIs.

## How Campaigns Work

**Entry:** Campaigns unlock when sufficient [Eagle Range coverage](../archetypes/eagle.md) exists in the domain. Some campaigns require minimum player counts; others require prerequisite campaigns completed.

**The room:** Each campaign room has a starting Current, an active Void Pressure tracker, a Drift stage indicator, and a live Pe feed from the THRML engine. The room is not static — it responds to what players do.

**Scoring:** Players submit platform scores within the domain. Accurate scores (True Read confirmed) reduce the room's Current. Inaccurate scores (ICC failure) raise Void Pressure.

**The VoidStorm:** When collective Void Pressure crosses the Storm Threshold, the room destabilizes — Current spikes, enemy types shift, vocabulary in the room turns Captured. The party needs to purge VP to stabilize.

**Completion:** A campaign completes when the domain's Current drops below threshold and is sustained there for the required window. Completion fires the Domain Seal event — the platform is marked NAMED in the Observatory permanently.

## Current Campaigns

### Season 1 Active

| Campaign | Domain | Pe Baseline | Status | Gate |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|------|
| **The Feed** | Social feed algorithms | 8–12 | Active | Open |
| **Oxycontin Cascade** | Prescription opioids / pharma | 11–44 | Active | 20 pharma Range players |
| **Cartel Void** | Criminal organization opacity | 9–12 | Active | Open |
| **Democratic Backslide** | Institutional erosion | 7–10 | Active | Open |
| **Synthetic Bond** | AI companions | 9–12 | Active | 15 AI-companion Range players |
| **The Parish** | Religious institution capture | 8–11 | Active | Open |
| **Mystic's Thread** | Esoteric capture / new age platforms | 7–10 | Active | Open |
| **Reformer's Hammer** | Activist capture / manufactured dissent | 8–11 | Active | Open |
| **Watergate Thread** | Institutional opacity at maximum | 10–13 | Active | Anchor-tier only |
| **Solidarity Campaign** | Labor capture / union opacity | 7–10 | Active | Open |

### G5 — The War Effort

The **Gates of Qliphoth** is the server-wide war effort. Not a campaign — a meta-event. When ten domain quotas are met simultaneously, the Moon Gate opens for a 24-hour siege window. The Godhand Five encounters become accessible.

Ten domains at Current threshold = ten quotas = the gate opens.

*Full war effort design: pending G5 build.*

## Campaign Party Roles

The four archetypes play different roles in campaign rooms:

| Archetype | Primary role |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Lion** | Entry. Confronts highest-Pe platforms directly. Pe falls fastest with Lions in room. |
| **Ox** | Floor. Invariant Floor technique prevents Pe from reverting after Lion gains. |
| **Eagle** | Map. Pre-lights the domain with Ghost Signals before campaign opens. Unlocks gates. |
| **Human** | Integration. Resonance Cascade tightens everyone's scores. Cross-domain evidence network. |

**Optimal composition:** 1–2 Lions (confrontation spike), 1–2 Oxen (floor hold), 1 Eagle (Ghost Signal navigation), 1 Human (network integration). Scales with room size.

## Domain Seal

When a campaign completes, the domain is marked NAMED in the Observatory. The NAMED marker is permanent — the platform has its true mechanism in the public academic record.

A NAMED domain:
- No longer accepts standard Current scoring (use the Maintenance scoring track instead)
- Displays its full scoring history publicly
- Is added to the ICC calibration baseline — new players learn to score against it
- Shows NAMED in the Observatory with the completion date and contributor count

NAMED is not forever-sealed. Platforms change. If a NAMED platform's mechanism changes significantly (restructure, acquisition, new regulatory environment), players can petition for a Re-Examination — the campaign reopens at the new baseline.

## The Egypt Class

Egypt-class campaigns are House of Bondage scenarios. The player is not outside scoring a platform — they are inside an extraction architecture that has held them (or others they know) for a long time.

The Pharaoh entity doesn't respond to standard Pe scoring because it will not be named. Breaking it requires the ten-event sequence — ten successive scoring victories that each remove a layer of Egypt's opacity.

The final event requires 3%+ of the active room players to have active Vows simultaneously. If the threshold holds, the campaign resolves. Pe drops to 0. The **Exodus event** fires.

*Egypt-class campaigns are marked (E) in the Observatory. Current Season 1 Egypt-class: Oxycontin Cascade.*
