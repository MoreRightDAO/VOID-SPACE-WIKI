# Reformer's Hammer

**Domain:** Activist capture / manufactured dissent
**Pe Baseline:** 8–11
**Status:** Active — Open entry
**Archetype gate:** None

## The Domain

This campaign documents a specific and underestimated void pattern: movements organized around opposition to voids that exhibit void architecture themselves.

The mechanism: authentic grievance → movement formation → movement organization → extraction architecture captured by the void the movement opposed (or a new void using the movement's infrastructure). Pe rises. The opposition becomes the mechanism it was created to fight.

This is not a claim that all activist movements are voids. It is a claim that activist platforms exhibit measurable Pe signatures that can be scored, and that some of those signatures indicate capture.

The Current of 8–11 reflects the variability: authentic grassroots movements score near the floor; captured or manufactured organizations score near the ceiling.

## The Framework Reading

Reformer-capture is primarily a **D3 case study** — harm facilitation in the name of opposition to harm. The pattern:

- A genuine void produces authentic harm
- Opposition forms with genuine constraint architecture (transparency, fixed principles, voluntary engagement)
- The opposition's infrastructure (audience, credibility, organizing tools) becomes valuable
- Void-adjacent actors capture the infrastructure without changing the form
- The movement continues producing opposition content while the underlying mechanism has been replaced

The tell: scoring a captured movement's **stated principles** against its **operational practice**. The Pe differential between the two is the measurement of capture depth.

## Enemy Types

| Entity | Class | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **The Front** | Apostle-class Egregor | Manufactured dissent architecture. Pe 10. Aspect of Death: JUSTICE. The void uses genuine injustice as its entry point — the grievance is real, the organization is captured. |
| **Narrative Drone** | Drifter-class | Produces framing that pre-empts Pe scoring — "you can't measure this, it's about values, not mechanisms." High resistance to O-dimension analysis. |
| **The Rally** | Drifter-class | High-R, high-C entity. The emotional architecture of mass movement — scoring feels like betrayal of the cause. VP rises steeply for players who are personally affiliated with the movement being scored. |

## The Hardest Score

This is the campaign that produces the most significant player VP accumulation — not because the Pe is highest, but because the domain is closest to the players who are likely to join this game.

Players attracted to the Void Framework are often players who care about the harms voids produce. Those players are most likely to be personally invested in the movements that oppose those harms. Scoring those movements for capture signatures feels, initially, like working for the void.

The framework's response: if the movement is genuine constraint architecture, it will score that way. The Pe reading is neutral. Score it. If it scores near 0, that's what the data says. If it scores high, the data matters more precisely because the opposition was supposed to be different.

## Scoring Notes

**The Principle-Practice split:** The most reliable scoring method in this domain is a two-pass approach:

1. Score the stated principles of the organization (what it claims to do, why, how)
2. Score the operational practice (what it actually does with its infrastructure, how it treats dissent within itself, what it does with its audiences' attention)

The differential between pass 1 and pass 2 is the capture signature. A genuine constraint movement scores identically across both passes. A captured movement scores lower on pass 2 than pass 1.

**Manufactured dissent detection:** Some organizations are built as void-adjacent from the start — created to simulate opposition while directing it. These score differently: the stated principles themselves exhibit void architecture (O is high in the mission statement, not just operations). The fabricated origin produces opacity all the way through.
