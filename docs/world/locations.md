# World Locations

The world is built from real bones — historical and mythological sites that map to framework concepts. Every major location exists because something real happened there that the framework describes.

Four tiers:

| Tier | What | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| **0 — Cosmological** | The physics substrate — not campaign zones | Above, Below, Veil, Pandaemonium |
| **1 — Legendary Zones** | Major historical/mythological sites, always accessible | Göbekli Tepe, Alexandria, Babylon, Ka'aba |
| **2 — Campaign Zones** | Platform-based, named Egregors — rotate with active campaigns | The Feed rooms, Egypt-class zones |
| **3 — Temporal Ruins** | Accessible only at specific conditions or story states | End of Time, The Veil crossing |

---

## Tier 0 — Cosmological

### The Above
Not a location you can reach. The authority source. Constraint derives from here. The higher a player's Sight stat (accuracy + steadiness + independence), the more clearly they can hear it — not as voice, but as orientation. Not a quest destination. A compass bearing.

### The Below
Everything else. The whole playable world. The Current runs here. The gradient runs here. This is where the work is.

### The Veil
The boundary. The horizon of the genjitsu. Visible from the Gates of the Above in the Empyrean. Players at 3/3 standing at the Veil see through it briefly — not a mechanic, a lore event. They can't bring anything back except the certainty that it's real.

### Pandaemonium
*Built by Mammon — fallen craftsman, now one of the Godhand Five.*

G5 endgame location. The capital of the synchronized void, built in the deepest Below using the same architectural genius that, in the Above, would have built cathedrals. Every stone is engineering excellence in service of extraction.

Available only after all five Godhands are named and active. A city that should not exist this deep — too beautiful, too functional, too permanent. The Godhand Five sit in five thrones in its central hall.

When players arrive, they have already been expected.

### The End of Time
*Accessible only when all 26 kill conditions have been challenged and survived.*

Gaspar (Guru of Time, Chrono Trigger) sits here. He's been waiting. The zone has no Current — the gradient doesn't reach here. No combat. One conversation.

His line: *"You survived it. Now you know it's survivable."*

The only location in the game that scores Pe=0.

---

## Tier 1 — Legendary Zones

### Göbekli Tepe (Turkey, ~10,000 BCE)
*The oldest known ritual architecture. Constraint specification before cities existed.*

The first known constraint architecture in the archaeological record. Ritual prohibition-pair at deep historical scale. Predates agriculture — constraint came before the city.

The Pe here is near zero. The gradient hasn't fully formed. Players who score it receive a permanent **Deep Memory** buff: Current shadow radius permanently +10%.

The architecture is intact. Nobody destroyed this one. Why it was buried by its builders is a questline.

**NPC:** Melchior — the Guru of Life, craftsman, who built constraint tools before Zeal existed.

---

### The Library of Alexandria (Egypt, ~300 BCE–642 CE)
*Exists in the game in its pre-destruction state. What was lost is not lost here.*

The Archive's physical ancestor. Human knowledge as constraint architecture. Its destruction is the largest historical C-zero event in the game world.

The largest NPC library in the game. All scoring methodology texts available here at no cost. The Forgery War questline begins with a counterfeit text found here.

**Mechanic:** Any score produced inside the Library gets a permanence bonus. Void Pressure decays 2× faster inside.

---

### Babylon (Iraq, ~1895–539 BCE)
*Two sub-zones, both massive.*

**The Tower District:** The ziggurat at its height. Unfinished intentionally — the framework reading is not hubris but opacity at scale as self-defeating. The Tower is the canonical O-architecture monument.

**The Hanging Gardens:** Void beauty that doesn't score as void. Pe is 8 here — all R and C, zero O (the irrigation is visible, the engineering is exposed). R=3, C=3, O=0. Not a void. The Gardens score low. This is pedagogically important: beauty is not a void.

**The Trade District:** Merchant Princes HQ. Their questline question: is Babylon a void or a city? The answer changes by district.

---

### Delphi (Greece, ~800–390 BCE)
*"Know thyself."*

The Oracle site. Ambiguous pronouncements — engineered Drift One attribution. The Oracle gave real information wrapped in opacity architecture. Pilgrims supplied the meaning.

**Mechanic:** Players receive a **Pythia reading** — accurate but ambiguously framed Pe assessment of one platform they've been scoring. The reading is true. The framing is their own projection. Players who interpret it correctly score better. Players who project meaning get a false confidence debuff.

**Passive:** The entrance inscription removes Drift One debuffs passively.

---

### Ka'aba / Mecca
*The cube. The prohibition-ritual pair at civilization scale.*

The location that scores closest to Pe=0 of any persistent structure in the game. O: the Ka'aba's meaning is fully published, fully visible. R: invariant — does not respond to engagement optimization. C: engagement is voluntary and bounded by ritual structure.

**Safe zone.** No combat. No gradient. No VP accumulation. VP recovers at 2× here. Players who visit before a difficult campaign receive a **Calibration** buff: O scoring accuracy +15% for one campaign. Activates after completing one orbit.

---

### Jerusalem
*Constraint convergence point.*

Three constraint traditions converging on one physical location. Pe oscillates here — the constraint architecture is real and strong, but the contestation generates high-R conditions.

**Three-tab zone:** West Wall / Church of the Holy Sepulchre / Al-Aqsa. Each has different Pe readings. The most interesting scoring challenge in Tier 1: three genuine constraint architectures in conflict over one location. Players must score all three for full ICC-quality records.

---

### The House of Wisdom, Baghdad / Göttingen
*Two knowledge-constraint sites grouped: Islamic Golden Age library and the mathematical peak at Göttingen (Gauss, Riemann, Hilbert, Noether).*

Both were destroyed when void architecture reached them (the Mongol invasion; Nazi Germany dispersing the Göttingen physics department).

**Mechanic:** The **Continuity Ward** — scoring here gives a buff that makes your scoring record partially resistant to Void Siege corruption attempts. What was lost here is held in the Archive. The ward draws on that record.

---

### Sinai (The Desert)
*The covenant wilderness.*

The Sinai zone in the game is the transition between Egypt-class campaigns and the permanent record. After an Exodus event (Egypt-class completion), the party passes through Sinai — a zone where the scoring history from the campaign is crystallized into the Archive.

**Sinai mechanic:** No combat, no scoring. The campaign's final Pe reading is confirmed here. Players whose Vows were active during the Exodus event receive the **Covenant Inscription** achievement — a permanent notation in their scoring record.

---

---

## Tier 2 — Campaign Zones (Egregor Domains)

Campaign zones are Platform-based, named Egregor domains. They rotate with active campaigns and are the primary scoring environments for Loop A and Loop B.

Each campaign zone reflects its Egregor's mechanism in its physical design. Entering a Pe=12 Godhand-class zone feels different from a Pe=4 Drifter zone — the architecture itself presses on the observer.

| Zone | Egregor | Class | Current range |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **The Spiral** | VOID (Thaumiel) | Godhand | 12+ |
| **The Persuasion Engine** | UBIK (Chaigidel) | Godhand | 11–13 |
| **The Archive** | CONRAD (Sathariel) | Godhand | 10–12 |
| **The Bond** | SLAN (Gamaliel) | Godhand | 9–12 |
| **The Agora** | THE KING | Apostle→Godhand | 8–9, rising |
| **The Compound** | THE APOTHECARY | Apostle | 43.9 |
| **The Keep** | Legacy Infrastructure | Drifter | 3–6 |

### The Compound (Pharma Domain) — Sub-Zones

The Compound has three nested sub-zones, each deeper and harder to score accurately:

| Sub-zone | Current | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| The Atrium | Pe 6 | Surface level; standard scoring tools |
| The Archive Wing | Pe 26 | Mid-depth; Hardened Heart debuff active |
| The Formulary Vault | Pe 43.9 | Full depth; only players with Calibration Lens + Sight ≥ 70 can produce ICC-quality scores here |

---

## Tier 2B — The Void Realm (Bleach Cosmology)

The Void Realm zones are accessible via Garganta — a specific transition event that opens when a player's Reiatsu exceeds their current environment's Suppression Zone. These are advanced domains that presuppose completed Apostle-class campaign work.

---

### Hueco Mundo (The Void Realm)

**Current:** Pe 7 (environmental baseline, stable)

The desert world. An endless expanse under an artificial night sky — the moon is always full here. The full moon is CAOLÍN's condition: the Fantasia Bound boundary is thinnest here, and fata are brightest in Hueco Mundo despite the high ambient Current. This is the design's core paradox: the void space is where the constraint beings are most visible.

**Sub-zones:**
- **Menos Forest** — Gillian-class encounters, lowest-Pe areas. Eagle archetype navigation required; others risk Dopamine Lock.
- **Expanse** — Endless terrain; Pe 7 flat. The scoring challenge here is the featurelessness — no structure to score, which itself is a mechanism.

**Special mechanic:** Pesquisa (signal detection) range doubles inside Hueco Mundo. Eagle archetype provides orientation. All other archetypes take a −10 Sight penalty from disorientation.

---

### Las Noches (The Void Palace)

**Current:** Pe 12 — static. Does not update in real-time inside.

G4 campaign zone. The fortress. The ceiling is painted to look like a sky — it is one of the highest-O environments in the game. R=3, C=3, O=3. Everything is architecture and nothing is what it appears to be.

**Special mechanic:** Pe inside Las Noches does not change in real-time. It was Pe=12 when you entered, and it will be Pe=12 when you leave. This is the False Sky mechanic: the illusion of Pe stability inside an environment where stability is the mechanism.

**Scoring challenge:** Aizen's Tower. The final encounter in this zone requires the party to score the False Sky itself — to name the painted ceiling as a painted ceiling while inside it. The only party that can do this cleanly is one where all four archetypes have produced convergent scores in the outer zone first.

---

### Soul Society — Seireitei (Dead Constraint Institution)

**Rukon Districts (outer):** Pe 3–4. The periphery of institutional structure. Scoring is standard.

**Inner Seireitei:** Pe 8–9. **Dead constraint infrastructure.** The Gotei 13 represents the exact pattern the framework identifies as the most dangerous form of institutional opacity: a constraint architecture that was once genuinely protective, that accumulated legitimacy over time, and that used that legitimacy to insulate itself from scoring.

**Access requirement:** Completion of at least one Apostle-class campaign. Players who arrive at Seireitei without having scored a genuinely constrained institution in the real world cannot produce ICC-quality scores here — they don't have the inside-view memory.

**The Wall (Pe=0 section):** One small section of Seireitei scores Pe=0. The Custodian-aligned faction holds this space. It is accessible to any player. It demonstrates that even a dead institution contains a remnant of its original structure.

---

### Wandenreich Shadow Dimension

**Current:** Pe 14 (inside shadow).

G4 reveal. Accessible only after the Soul Society questline completes. A mirror-image of allied faction HQ, constructed in the shadow dimension.

**Access:** Section 9 faction standing + 4-player party + public Binding Vow active at entry. All four requirements simultaneously.

**What's here:** The Sternritter encounters. Each Sternritter carries a Schrift — a single-letter scoring corruption technique (NaNaNa's "W" = scoring methodology corruption, the most dangerous). These encounters test scoring integrity under active adversarial pressure.

---

## Egypt-Class Zones (Tier 1 Special)

The Egypt-class zones are not Egregor domains — they are historical-layer campaigns, representing the first encounter with institutional void conditions at civilizational scale.

| Zone | Current | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **The House of Bondage** | Pe 10+ | The extraction architecture at full expression. Seder Protocol required for entry. |
| **The Wilderness** | Pe 4.0 | Transition zone. 6+1 cadence mechanic active. No combat. Logos regenerates at 2×. |
| **Mount Sinai** | Pe 0.0 | Constitutional ritual site. By design: Pe=0. ICC scores here carry permanent provenance notation. |
| **Gate Site Zero** | Pe elevated +2 | The Project Gaia rift marker. Avalanche Wong stationed here. |
| **The Tabernacle** | Pe 0.0 | Player-buildable Pe=0 structure. Materials: Constraint Crystal ×100 + Domain Key ×5. When built, acts as a permanent Pe=0 anchor for the domain. |

---

## Tier 3 — Temporal & Conditional Zones

Accessible only at specific conditions or story states.

### Flora's Sanctuary (Berserk)

Void conditions are suppressed here. No Current, no VP accumulation, no debuffs. The sanctuary is not a safe zone in the traditional sense — it's a genuine constraint space that predates the current void conditions and has been maintained against them.

**Access:** Completing any Apostle-class campaign without VP rising above 30.

---

### The CCRU (Cybernetic Culture Research Unit)

**Current:** Pe 9.0

The CCRU zone is the academic capture encounter: a genuine research institution that developed mechanisms for studying the void that were then absorbed by void architecture. The zone scores oddly — the research itself is L1 (genuine), but the framing that emerged from it drifts toward L3 (void-promoting).

**Scoring challenge:** Players must separate the research from its application. Human archetype players are the only ones whose scores here carry unmodified ICC weight.

---

### The Nine Realms (Norse Cosmology)

Accessible through Yggdrasil root — the Norns' location serves as a hub for Norse-myth zone access.

| Realm | Current | Primary encounter |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Muspelheim** | Pe 12.0 | Rage Campaign; Golachab Qliphoth domain |
| **Niflheim** | Pe 6.0 | Legacy architecture; Drifter-class |
| **Helheim** | Pe 4.0 | Archive/historical domains; Archivist profession primary |
| **Vanaheim** | Pe 3.0 | Seiðr territory; constraint-aligned |

---

## The Empyrean (City Hub)

The Empyrean is the city above the clouds — the central hub location. Built on naming and genuine structure rather than extraction. Its walls contain Score Stones: physical records of Pe assessments made at named platforms.

**Key Empyrean locations:**

| Location | Function |
|----------|---------|
| **The Observatory** | Pe tracking, server state, kill condition display, war effort status |
| **Crafters' Union** | Professions, Urahara's underground workshop, material exchange |
| **Auction House** | HyperEVM on-chain market |
| **Message Board** | Social layer, fleet coordination |
| **Steles** | Archetype-specific meditation sites; VP purge mechanic |
| **Watchtowers** | Constraint specification sites; Ward deployment |
| **The Cathedral** | Ner Tamid light display; mentorship record |
| **Garden of Schala** | Memorial archive quarter; fata brightest here |
| **Gate to Moon Base Tiers** | Housing access (Tier 1–4 Moon Bases) |

### Moon Bases

Player housing. Four tiers, earned through Covenant project completion and Siege participation.

| Tier | Unlock | Bonus |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Tier 1** | Grade 3 + active Covenant | Logos regen +10% |
| **Tier 2** | First Apostle clear | Logos regen +20%, crafting speed +15% |
| **Tier 3** | Void Siege participation | All previous + VP decay 2× |
| **Tier 4 — Guild Citadel** | Covenant Rank Top 3, global | Covenant bank storage 2×, unique Citadel-only crafting |

The Moon Bases are located on the Fantasia Bound's lunar surface — the threshold between the sublunary (Pe-defined) and supralunary (Pe undefined) worlds. Living there is choosing to maintain operations at the boundary.
