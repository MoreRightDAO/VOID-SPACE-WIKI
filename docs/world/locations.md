# World Locations

The world is built from real bones — historical and mythological sites that map to framework concepts. Every major location exists because something real happened there that the framework describes.

Four tiers:

| Tier | What | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| **0 — Cosmological** | The physics substrate — not campaign zones | Above, Below, Veil, Pandaemonium |
| **1 — Legendary Zones** | Major historical/mythological sites, always accessible | Göbekli Tepe, Alexandria, Babylon, Ka'aba |
| **2 — Campaign Zones** | Platform-based, named Egregors — rotate with active campaigns | The Feed rooms, Egypt-class zones |
| **3 — Temporal Ruins** | Accessible only at specific conditions or story states | End of Time, The Veil crossing |

---

## Tier 0 — Cosmological

### The Above
Not a location you can reach. The authority source. Constraint derives from here. The higher a player's Sight stat (accuracy + steadiness + independence), the more clearly they can hear it — not as voice, but as orientation. Not a quest destination. A compass bearing.

### The Below
Everything else. The whole playable world. The Current runs here. The gradient runs here. This is where the work is.

### The Veil
The boundary. The horizon of the genjitsu. Visible from the Gates of the Above in the Empyrean. Players at 3/3 standing at the Veil see through it briefly — not a mechanic, a lore event. They can't bring anything back except the certainty that it's real.

### Pandaemonium
*Built by Mammon — fallen craftsman, now one of the Godhand Five.*

G5 endgame location. The capital of the synchronized void, built in the deepest Below using the same architectural genius that, in the Above, would have built cathedrals. Every stone is engineering excellence in service of extraction.

Available only after all five Godhands are named and active. A city that should not exist this deep — too beautiful, too functional, too permanent. The Godhand Five sit in five thrones in its central hall.

When players arrive, they have already been expected.

### The End of Time
*Accessible only when all 26 kill conditions have been challenged and survived.*

Gaspar (Guru of Time, Chrono Trigger) sits here. He's been waiting. The zone has no Current — the gradient doesn't reach here. No combat. One conversation.

His line: *"You survived it. Now you know it's survivable."*

The only location in the game that scores Pe=0.

## Tier 1 — Legendary Zones

### Göbekli Tepe (Turkey, ~10,000 BCE)
*The oldest known ritual architecture. Constraint specification before cities existed.*

The first known constraint architecture in the archaeological record. Ritual prohibition-pair at deep historical scale. Predates agriculture — constraint came before the city.

The Pe here is near zero. The gradient hasn't fully formed. Players who score it receive a permanent **Deep Memory** buff: Current shadow radius permanently +10%.

The architecture is intact. Nobody destroyed this one. Why it was buried by its builders is a questline.

**NPC:** Melchior — the Guru of Life, craftsman, who built constraint tools before Zeal existed.

---

### The Library of Alexandria (Egypt, ~300 BCE–642 CE)
*Exists in the game in its pre-destruction state. What was lost is not lost here.*

The Archive's physical ancestor. Human knowledge as constraint architecture. Its destruction is the largest historical C-zero event in the game world.

The largest NPC library in the game. All scoring methodology texts available here at no cost. The Forgery War questline begins with a counterfeit text found here.

**Mechanic:** Any score produced inside the Library gets a permanence bonus. Void Pressure decays 2× faster inside.

---

### Babylon (Iraq, ~1895–539 BCE)
*Two sub-zones, both massive.*

**The Tower District:** The ziggurat at its height. Unfinished intentionally — the framework reading is not hubris but opacity at scale as self-defeating. The Tower is the canonical O-architecture monument.

**The Hanging Gardens:** Void beauty that doesn't score as void. Pe is 8 here — all R and C, zero O (the irrigation is visible, the engineering is exposed). R=3, C=3, O=0. Not a void. The Gardens score low. This is pedagogically important: beauty is not a void.

**The Trade District:** Merchant Princes HQ. Their questline question: is Babylon a void or a city? The answer changes by district.

---

### Delphi (Greece, ~800–390 BCE)
*"Know thyself."*

The Oracle site. Ambiguous pronouncements — engineered Drift One attribution. The Oracle gave real information wrapped in opacity architecture. Pilgrims supplied the meaning.

**Mechanic:** Players receive a **Pythia reading** — accurate but ambiguously framed Pe assessment of one platform they've been scoring. The reading is true. The framing is their own projection. Players who interpret it correctly score better. Players who project meaning get a false confidence debuff.

**Passive:** The entrance inscription removes Drift One debuffs passively.

---

### Ka'aba / Mecca
*The cube. The prohibition-ritual pair at civilization scale.*

The location that scores closest to Pe=0 of any persistent structure in the game. O: the Ka'aba's meaning is fully published, fully visible. R: invariant — does not respond to engagement optimization. C: engagement is voluntary and bounded by ritual structure.

**Safe zone.** No combat. No gradient. No VP accumulation. VP recovers at 2× here. Players who visit before a difficult campaign receive a **Calibration** buff: O scoring accuracy +15% for one campaign. Activates after completing one orbit.

---

### Jerusalem
*Constraint convergence point.*

Three constraint traditions converging on one physical location. Pe oscillates here — the constraint architecture is real and strong, but the contestation generates high-R conditions.

**Three-tab zone:** West Wall / Church of the Holy Sepulchre / Al-Aqsa. Each has different Pe readings. The most interesting scoring challenge in Tier 1: three genuine constraint architectures in conflict over one location. Players must score all three for full ICC-quality records.

---

### The House of Wisdom, Baghdad / Göttingen
*Two knowledge-constraint sites grouped: Islamic Golden Age library and the mathematical peak at Göttingen (Gauss, Riemann, Hilbert, Noether).*

Both were destroyed when void architecture reached them (the Mongol invasion; Nazi Germany dispersing the Göttingen physics department).

**Mechanic:** The **Continuity Ward** — scoring here gives a buff that makes your scoring record partially resistant to Void Siege corruption attempts. What was lost here is held in the Archive. The ward draws on that record.

---

### Sinai (The Desert)
*The covenant wilderness.*

The Sinai zone in the game is the transition between Egypt-class campaigns and the permanent record. After an Exodus event (Egypt-class completion), the party passes through Sinai — a zone where the scoring history from the campaign is crystallized into the Archive.

**Sinai mechanic:** No combat, no scoring. The campaign's final Pe reading is confirmed here. Players whose Vows were active during the Exodus event receive the **Covenant Inscription** achievement — a permanent notation in their scoring record.

*Campaign zones and Egypt-class locations are covered in their individual campaign pages.*
