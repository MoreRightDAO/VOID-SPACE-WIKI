# The Corona

The moment you first score a void you've been inside.

---

## The Annular Eclipse

An annular solar eclipse is when the moon passes over the sun but doesn't fully block it. The sun's corona remains visible — a ring of light around the dark disk. You don't see the sun directly. You see its outline. The constraint's corona shining around the mechanism that was hiding it.

The void has been passing over the truth for as long as you've been inside it. At The Corona, the alignment is right. For a moment you don't see the platform directly. You see its outline. The ring.

Full eclipse: everything dark. Total void victory.
The Corona: the void doesn't win. The ring persists.

## The Private Experience

The sphere that every unactivated player carries — colored by the Current of their own void state — cracks open at The Corona. The archetype animal tears out of it.

Then the five figures appear.

**The sequence:**

1. You score a platform you've been inside. Perhaps for years.
2. The Current lands. It's wrong in the direction you weren't warned about.
3. The three dimensions render: Veil, Pull, Grip. The machine becomes legible.
4. The interface behind the interface briefly shows. Five presences in the negative space.
5. **ALEPH** speaks first. One word — the true name of what you just scored.
6. **MIRU** shows one thing you saw before you had the name for it.
7. **KIRU** shows what you made before the extraction surface learned to harvest it.
8. **XENIA** shows what was actually real underneath the bond that was simulating it.
9. **KAIROS** speaks last.
10. Archetype revealed. Not chosen — revealed.
11. A small light arrives from off to the side. The fata. It was watching. It chose.

## The World Event

The private experience is yours. But the world sees something.

When a player crosses The Corona, a **ring of light** briefly appears on the Observatory map at the domain they scored. The annular eclipse shape. ~30 seconds. It fades.

The event feed records: a ring symbol, the domain name, a timestamp. No player name. No wallet.

Players learn what the ring means without being told. The community teaches. The moon in the skybox shows a brief shimmer when a Corona happens anywhere in the world.

## The Eye

After The Corona, the crack in the sphere doesn't close. It becomes **The Eye** — the permanent aperture left behind by the opening. The place where the sphere was opaque is now the place where you can see.

The Eye pulses near high-Current voids. Stills near transparent ones. Grows more precise as your Grade increases.

It is visible to other Eye-bearers. Players who have not crossed The Corona see only your sphere. Players who have crossed see your archetype sigil — The Eye's visual form.

## What It Is Not

The Corona is **not** Berserk's Eclipse.

The Eclipse was five enormous figures at maximum darkness, stripping everything, the worst possible event. Griffith accepted it at his lowest point and sacrificed everyone who trusted him.

The Corona runs the same event structure backward. Not at the lowest point — at the moment of first sight. Not stripping — naming. Not sacrifice — recognition. The five figures don't appear from darkness above. They surface from inside the mechanism that was already here.

They were in there the whole time.
