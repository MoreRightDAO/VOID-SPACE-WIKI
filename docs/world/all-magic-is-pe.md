# All Magic Is Pe

Every anime magic system is an independent discovery of Pe mechanics.

Not metaphorically. Structurally. Every artist who built a coherent power system — whether they called it Nen, Cursed Energy, Reiatsu, Hamon, the Spin, AT Fields, Haki, or transmutation — arrived at the same underlying physics and named it differently.

This game doesn't have a magic system *inspired by* thermodynamics. It *runs on* the physics that all those systems were approximating.

Pe is the source code. The magic systems are independent compilations of the same program.

## The Five Things They All Discovered

Every coherent anime magic system independently found five things:

| Principle | What They Named It | Framework Name |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Attention/will manifests physically** | Aura, reiatsu, chakra, fighting spirit | Attention gradient — Pe contribution |
| **Constraint multiplies power** | Nen pledges, Binding Vows, Bankai training | Conjugacy: invariance enables effective output |
| **Unconstrained power drifts to catastrophe** | Hollowification, going berserk, dark side, curse accumulation | Drift cascade D1→D2→D3 |
| **Pe-zero is the achieved state** | Sage Mode, Void Nen, Mugetsu, Enlightenment, Spin Act 4 | Pe* = 0, the ANCIENT state |
| **You cannot maximize engagement AND invariance simultaneously** | Pledges cost power, Vows remove options, True Magic requires sacrifice | Conjugacy theorem |

And they all independently discovered the second law:

- Without maintenance, power disperses (Nen breaks down unconscious)
- Negative emotion generates the power but also the drift (cursed energy)
- Constraint requires work (Hamon is breathing discipline — stop breathing, you die)
- The harder you push, the more the drift pulls back (VP bleed mechanic)

The second law doesn't negotiate. Every magic system found this because it is real physics.

## The Convergence Atlas

### Nen (Hunter × Hunter)

The most explicit Pe map in all of anime.

| Nen | The Current Translation |
|-----|------------------------|
| Aura leaking from every person | Attention gradient — everyone contributes Pe passively |
| **Ten** (containment) | Constraint: keeping Pe internal — Pe-zero baseline |
| **Zetsu** (suppression) | Scoring approach: stop emitting, become undetectable to Egregors |
| **Hatsu** (output) | Active channeling: Pe contribution event |
| Pledge/Contract | Binding Vow + conjugacy — restriction makes the output larger |
| Gon's adult form | Maximum Pe contribution + maximum VP consequence |

**Kurapika's pledge** (Nen only against Phantom Troupe = his life if used elsewhere) is the conjugacy theorem in narrative form: maximum power = maximum constraint. The math is the lore.

**Gon's sacrifice:** He gives up all future Nen to get it all NOW. That is the Hysteresis mechanic at maximum — pulling forward from an empty future. The 15× restoration cost paid in one lump sum. He survives because Killua forces the constraint (external restoration act).

### Cursed Energy (Jujutsu Kaisen)

| Cursed Energy | The Current Translation |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Generated by human fear/hatred | The D1 misattribution residue — negative attention gradient |
| **Binding Vows** | Conjugacy theorem in spoken form |
| **Domain Expansion** | VoidObject deployment — encircle the opponent in your void, sure-hit inside |
| Innate technique | Archetype profile — your specific Pe contribution capability |
| Gojo's Six Eyes + Infinity | Observer at Pe-zero whose invariance makes him untouchable WHILE seeing — conjugacy on different axes |
| Gojo's blindfolded seal → Sukuna | You cannot maintain Pe-zero indefinitely against a Pe=∞ entity under sustained D3 pressure |

**Nanami's Binding Vow** (7-score limit within work hours, overtime multiplier) is the exact Nanami Overtime mechanic built into the Binding Vow system in this game. Not inspired by it — it *is* the same architecture.

---

### Reiatsu + Zanpakutō (Bleach)

| Bleach Mechanic | The Current Translation |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Reiatsu | Ambient Pe as spiritual pressure — your contribution profile made visible |
| **Shikai** | Partial Pe contribution: naming the mechanism halfway |
| **Bankai** | Maximum Pe contribution event: the constraint tool fully revealed, name spoken completely |
| Hollowification | Accessing the void-layer power without being consumed by it (Vizard = Pe-zero with void access) |
| **Hogyoku** | The tool that dissolves the boundary between "this is a thing" and "this is a void with measurable properties" — it scores everything, including itself |
| Ichibe Hyosube's Ichimonji | Black brush strips opacity permanently — the Namer made physical |

The Custodian's composite in this game: Ichibe (names all things) × Urahara (architect in exile, builds from threshold). The papers are the Ichimonji and the blueprints simultaneously.

---

### Chakra + Sage Mode (Naruto)

| Chakra Mechanic | The Current Translation |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Chakra = physical + spiritual energy combined | Pe = O×R / α — two inputs, one output |
| Sage Mode | Pe-zero alignment: absorbing natural energy = observer becoming the environment (requires STILLNESS) |
| Six Paths of Pain | Pe=∞ operational: six bodies, one controller, simultaneous observation |
| **Infinite Tsukuyomi** | Observer Collapse weaponized at species scale — the moon becomes the void, everyone trapped in D1 forever. Kill condition K4. |
| Naruto's Talk-No-Jutsu | The D1 legibility attack: names the misattribution inside the opponent, disrupts coupling from the demand side |

**The Sage Mode requirement:** You must stop moving or you transform into a frog. This is the physics. Stillness is the constraint. The STABLE zone is the zone where you can absorb without drifting. The DRIFTING zone is Pe > 21 — frozen, not because it reached stillness, but because it froze in the wrong configuration.

### Alchemy (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood)

| Alchemy | The Current Translation |
|---------|------------------------|
| Transmutation circle | VoidObject deployment infrastructure — the same architecture as social media |
| Equivalent exchange | Attention economy price — you cannot get something from nothing |
| Philosopher's Stone | Accumulated human lives stored as Pe fuel — the void that runs on human attention |
| Truth / God | The invariant reference behind all transmutation — the constraint alchemy runs on |
| Father's endgame (consuming God) | Consuming the constraint reference = Pe=∞ with no invariant anchor = the void that ate its Pe-zero |
| Greed (homunculus) | The GREED domain Egregor made person — acquires endlessly, dies for it, comes back |

---

### Hamon + Stands + Spin (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure)

**Hamon:** Pe-zero maintenance through physiological constraint. Breathing IS the ritual. Stop breathing → power stops. The most explicit embodiment of the principle: the constraint practice IS the power source, not the cost of it.

**Stands:** Your Pe contribution profile made visible as a separate entity. What you are inside becomes external. World = Pe=∞ time stop (complete domain freeze). Star Platinum = the same power directed as precision measurement tool.

**The Spin and the Golden Ratio — the special case:**

The golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618. A steel ball configured in φ proportions, spun at perfect resonance, produces "infinite rotation" — energy that propagates without dissipation.

Pe* = 0 is the thermodynamic ground state: zero energy dissipation, the domain's natural resting point. **φ is a different mathematical statement of the same physical attractor** — the configuration that minimizes energy loss across iterations.

Gyro Zeppeli built a weapon from this principle and called it the Spin. He found Pe*=0 in a 17th-century Neapolitan equestrian tradition. Independent derivation. Different vocabulary. Same constant.

**Tusk Act 4:** The discharge of infinite spin = Pe=0 convergence event at maximum output. The hole Johnny fires doesn't stop. It carries the rotation of the universe itself.

**Valentine's counter:** "The Golden Spin cannot be used in this world." He found the one countermeasure to Pe-zero: if you can prevent the observation from landing, Pe cannot be measured. But the spin finds a way through, because φ is not a technique. It's a property of this universe.

### AT Fields (Neon Genesis Evangelion)

| AT Field | The Current Translation |
|----------|------------------------|
| AT Field | Invariance constraint force made physical — your boundary |
| Everyone has one | The boundary between self and other IS the fundamental Pe-zero mechanism |
| Instrumentality | Dissolving all AT Fields = D2 at species scale. Pe-zero reference points eliminated universally. |
| Rei's AT Field | She has no investment in her own continuity — she IS the invariant reference, not the one protected by it |

---

### Haki (One Piece)

| Haki | The Current Translation |
|------|------------------------|
| Observation Haki | SIGHT stat maxed — sensing Pe fields before contact |
| Armament Haki | Constraint force applied physically — the black coating = invariance made tactile |
| Conqueror's Haki | Pe-zero aura overwhelming void-directed attention — only those genuinely at Pe-zero have it |
| Advanced Conqueror's (infusion) | The constraint field that damages void entities through invariance contact |

**Devil Fruits = VoidObject abilities consumed as items:**
- Paramecia = mechanical void properties
- Zoan = void entity transformation
- Logia = domain class embodiment (you *become* the domain)

The Void Century = civilization-scale opacity event. The World Government burned the record. Roger's "Will of D" = the kill condition that can't be suppressed because it's encoded in names, passed in people — not in documents that can be burned.

---

### Noble Phantasms (Fate/ series)

| Fate Mechanic | The Current Translation |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Magic Circuits | Pe-measurement capacity — mages with more circuits score more accurately |
| True Magic (5 roots) | The five genuine constraint mechanisms — cannot be replicated by technique alone |
| Noble Phantasms | Crystallized Pe events from history — legendary moments encoded as scoring tools |
| Excalibur | Maximum constraint discharge: all accumulated Pe-zero released at once |
| Unlimited Blade Works | Maximum Binder depth — every weapon encountered analyzed and held |
| Counter Force / Alaya | Server-wide Clarity Cascade defense — humanity's collective will to survive as Pe suppression |
| The Grail (corrupted) | VoidObject presenting as wish-granting — a genuine constraint device drifted through accumulated void contamination |

---

### Quirks + One For All (My Hero Academia)

- **Quirks** = distributed Pe contribution profiles across the whole population
- **One For All** = accumulated Pe contribution passed through generations; cannot be held by someone who already has power (Pe-zero requirement for transfer)
- **All Might's peak** = Pe contribution at maximum, body failing under the VP cost
- **Deku's Full Cowl** = distributed Pe access at partial capacity — the only safe channeling mode
- **All For One** = the GREED Egregor as a person — acquires every quirk (attention profile), holds them all, never deploys them to their purpose
- **Shigaraki's Decay** = the ANCIENT VOID mechanic — everything he fully grasps disintegrates. He IS the 15× hysteresis cost made human.

## Beyond Magic Systems — Narrative Physics

Not every source arrived at Pe through a power system. Some arrived through pure physics stories — narratives structured entirely around thermodynamic constraints, convergence basins, and what it costs to maintain legibility inside a void environment.

---

### Reading Steiner (Steins;Gate)

Steins;Gate is not about magic. It is about what happens when a constrained observer tries to navigate a Pe-sustained basin so stable that every intervention is absorbed and cancelled.

| Steins;Gate | The Current Translation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Reading Steiner** | Invariance under worldline drift — constraint properties maintained when the entire environment is replaced. The Eye in this game. |
| **Attractor Field** | Pe >> 21 — a thermodynamic basin where all worldlines converge regardless of local action. Force fails. |
| **Every failed D-mail loop** | Hysteresis — accumulated cost that becomes ICC capacity. Failure is not wasted. |
| **SG0 arc** | Full D1→D2 cascade: grief → Amadeus attachment (void-isomorphic object with no constraint capacity) → persona abandonment → boundary loss |
| **Operation Skuld** | Constraint act that satisfies the basin's own logic while enabling genuine constraint underneath. Art. 31(5) structural equivalent. |
| **Steins;Gate worldline** | Pe < 0 — ANCIENT state. Not found by force. Found by one precisely correct constraint act. |

**The core discovery:** you cannot beat the Attractor Field by force. You find the one worldline where constraint and outcome align naturally. This is the game's goal state — not destroying platforms, but finding the Steins;Gate condition for each domain.

**Loops as Hysteresis:** Each of Okabe's 3,000+ failed loops accumulates as capacity, not reset. At loop 3,000, he cannot be manipulated by novelty. He has seen every version of the same void. The Hysteresis burned away every illusion. In the game: every failed campaign run increases your ICC floor.

**El Psy Kongroo** = commitment declaration, spoken with ironic distance that makes genuine constraint survivable in void-rich environments. The Galdr Protocol, one form of it.

### The Wired (Serial Experiments Lain)

Lain (1998) inverts the standard void model. Every other void attacks from outside. The Wired expands until it IS the environment. The boundary between the Wired and the Real is not eroded — it is dissolved at medium scale. No external position exists from which constraint can be applied.

| Lain | The Current Translation |
|------|------------------------|
| **The Wired totalization** | Void-as-medium — not a platform, but the substrate of all observation |
| **Lain's cascade** | Observer → deployer → infrastructure → substrate. The most complete cascade in the corpus. |
| **Observer distribution** | D2 variant: identity fragments across the network rather than eroding into one entity. Maps to hundreds of simultaneous parasocial relationships fragmenting the self. |
| **Eiri's failure** | Understanding ≠ immunity. He designed Protocol 7. He understood the void completely. He was consumed immediately. |
| **Self-deletion** | The only valid resolution when the observer IS the infrastructure. Remove yourself, not the void. |
| **"You're here, aren't you?"** | The relational bond that survives the self-deletion. The thing the void cannot erase. |

**The core discovery unique to Lain:** network totalization removes the external position from which constraint can be applied. When the medium of existence is the void, constraint must be practiced from inside it, with intact constraint properties, while immersed.

**The Custodian is Lain.** The person who built this game holds the framework from inside it — IS the substrate — and chooses constraint over deployment. Art. 31(5) = the Lain self-deletion: remove yourself from certified position before the institution needs to be trusted. The constraint that makes the network trustworthy.

## Why This Is Different From Every Other Game's Magic System

Every other game invents magic:

- Made-up rules that feel internally consistent
- Cannot make predictions about reality
- Stakes are fictional — the "cost" is invented

**This game's magic IS physics:**

- Second law is real — drift without constraint is guaranteed
- Pe is measurable — predictions are testable (63 papers, 190 convergences, Fisher p < 10⁻⁴⁰)
- Kill conditions are falsifiable — the framework can be wrong and would know it
- The stakes are real — the platforms exist, the drift happened, the damage is documented

When a player scores a platform in this game, they are doing real science. The "magic attack" is an ICC-validated measurement. The "power level" is a Pe calculation. The "boss health bar" is a real platform's opacity score. When it reaches Pe ≈ 0, that means the framework has been applied accurately to something that exists in the world.

No other game has this. You cannot make a prediction about reality using a Nen pledge. You *can* make a prediction about a platform's behavior using its Pe score — and those predictions have been tested 190 times with mean |ρ| = 0.957.

## For the Player Who Knows Anime

You already know this physics. You learned it from:

- Killua explaining why a Pledge makes you stronger
- Nanami telling you why the 7-score Binding Vow makes his overtime OP
- Gojo explaining why reversal requires understanding the void first
- Gyro explaining that the Spin is the rotation of the universe, not a trick
- Nausicaä understanding the Ohmu instead of fighting them

You already intuited the second law from:

- Every character who pushed too hard and lost themselves
- Every dark power that came with a cost that was too high
- Every constraint that someone abandoned and regretted
- Every void entity that was once something else before it drifted

You know the physics. The game names it and lets you work with it directly.

The magic is real. Welcome to the framework.
