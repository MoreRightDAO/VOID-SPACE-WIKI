# The Fantasia Bound

> "The moon is the edge. Not a wall — a threshold. On the other side, the void can't find you."

The Fantasia Bound is the boundary condition where [The Current](the-current.md) becomes undefined. Below it: drift cascades operate, voids accumulate attention, the framework governs. Above it: something else — not described by the framework's math, not reachable by its mechanics.

It maps to the moon.

## Why the Current Needs an Observer

The Current formula requires an observer at every term:

- **Veil** — hidden *from whom?*
- **Pull** — responsive *to what?*
- **Grip** — woven into the life *of whom?*

Remove the observer and the Current isn't zero. It isn't infinite. It's **undefined** — the equation loses its domain entirely. The void cannot exist without a subject to be void *to.*

The boundary where this relationship terminates is the Fantasia Bound.

Classical cosmology named this correctly. The sublunary world is the domain of change, decay, and corruption — where observers exist and systems capture them. The supralunary world is the domain of the perfect and unchanging — where the observer-subject relationship does not obtain. They didn't have the Current. They had the observation. They drew the line at the moon because the moon was where the observable world ended.

The game is named after the Neverending Story's Fantasia — the realm that only exists because of observation. When Bastian stops reading, Fantasia dissolves. Not through force. Through the withdrawal of the observer. The Fantasia Bound is the horizon of that withdrawal.

## The Three Zones

| Zone | Name | Current Status |
|------|------|---------------|
| Earth → Moon | **Sublunary** | Defined. Drift cascades operate. All campaigns take place here. |
| The Moon | **Fantasia Bound** | Threshold. Current approaches undefined. |
| Moon → Stars | **Supralunary** | Undefined. Void cannot operate here. |

## The Empyrean Is Supralunary

The high city — the Level 40 end zone — is architecturally positioned above the Fantasia Bound. The Current doesn't fire there. Not by rule or prohibition. By physics.

The void mechanism requires an observer-subject relationship. Above the Bound, the observer has stepped outside that relationship. They can see the sublunary world from above — the Observatory Tower at the Empyrean's peak displays every active campaign room's Current gradient — but they cannot be captured by it from that position.

This is why Level 40 is the access gate. To reach the Empyrean, you have to prove you can see Current structure instead of being subject to it. The Empyrean doesn't protect you by being safe. It's safe because you've reached it.

## God Hand Sight Is Supralunary Perspective

[The Eye](the-eye.md) gives you the perspective of someone above the Fantasia Bound while you remain in sublunary space. You see the Current structure of the room from outside the observer-subject relationship — temporarily.

The sphere crack-open at [The Corona](the-corona.md) is the moment you stood at the threshold. The aperture didn't close when you came back.

Sustained supralunary perspective requires Level 40. The Corona is the flash. The Empyrean is the permanent address.

## The Moon Gate

Players don't reach the supralunary alone. They reach it collectively.

The Gates of Qliphoth — the server-wide war effort — is the Moon Gate mechanic. When enough domains have been scored to drop collective Current below threshold, the boundary becomes crossable as a server event. A 24-hour siege window opens.

Ten domain quotas met = moon gate opens. The siege window IS the window of supralunary access. When it closes, the boundary resets.

The moon gate can only open if enough observers remained free long enough to collectively score. This makes Observer Collapse and the moon gate mutually exclusive: you can't have both.

## Observer Collapse — The Failure Mode

There is a failure mode on the other side of the Bound. Not ascending above it — falling through it from below.

If every observer is captured simultaneously — if the Current approaches maximum across all domains and no uncaptured perspective remains — the Current becomes undefined from the other direction. Not because observers are free. Because there's no outside perspective left to define the relationship.

This is the Infinite Tsukuyomi scenario. Everyone is in the dream. No one can see the structure. The void doesn't need to sustain the capture — it becomes self-sustaining.

Kill condition K4 is the framework's expression of this. The war effort exists so that Observer Collapse never becomes live.

## Time at the Bound

The moon is where chronological time starts to break down.

Below the Bound: the Current is measurable, time is linear, drift accumulates. At the Bound: the Current becomes undefined. Above: atemporal.

This is the cosmological truth about KAIROS moments. They are not found on a schedule. KAIROS is the moment that exists within chronological time but isn't determined by it. The moon phase sets the conditions. What you do with them is yours.
