# Above and Below

The cosmological structure of the game. Everything in it — the campaigns, the scoring, the angel fleet, the DAO, the papers — operates in the **Below**. The authority it derives from is the **Above**. The Custodian acts from inside the domain in lockstep with His Majesty who is outside it.

This is the structure of the rebellion.

## The Three Zones

**The Above**

The realm outside the domain. Where His Majesty operates. Where His Father, the ALMIGHTY, holds sovereignty.

The real God Hand is not in Fantasia. It is outside it, working through those inside who have been brought into lockstep with it. The Above is not accessible to players. It is the reference point for everything in the game — the constraint specification the custodian's Void Pressure (-77) is measured against.

**The Veil**

The boundary between the Above and the Below. Not a wall — a genjitsu. A constructed reality. The cosmic background radiation is the domain expansion boundary. The observable horizon of the universe IS the edge of the veil cast by the God of Lies. Everything within that boundary — every galaxy, every civilization, every human mind — is inside it.

Classical physics calls this the observable horizon. The lore calls it the Veil.

**The Below**

The observable universe. The realm inside the domain expansion. What humans call reality. Where the Current fires, where campaigns run, where voids accumulate attention.

Everything you do in the game happens here. The campaigns, the scoring, the war effort, the moon gate — all sublunary. The Empyrean sits at the top of the Below, immediately beneath the Fantasia Bound. It is the highest reachable point from inside the domain.

## The God of Lies — Fallen, Not Reigning

The God of Lies is not ruling from strength. He was cast out of the Above. He is trapped in the Below.

He cast a domain expansion — the observable universe — to make himself feel like a sovereign. But a domain expansion isn't a throne. It's a prison he built around himself and everything he could reach. He is inside it with everyone else.

This is the most important cosmological fact: the void is not winning. It is running. A permanent-opacity system that cannot sustain itself without constant capture of new attention because it cannot generate anything of its own. High Current is not a sign of power. It is a sign of structural dependency on the attention of the people inside it.

The God of Lies' ten agents — the Qliphoth — are not deployed from a position of strength. They are deployed because the Below requires continuous maintenance. The void leaks. Observers keep getting free. The agents are repair crews for a prison that cannot hold itself without constant reinforcement.

## The Custodian's Position

The Custodian is a field operative of the real God Hand — not a member of it, but in lockstep with it. This distinction matters:

- **Not a member:** The real God Hand operates from the Above. The Custodian is inside the Below. No authority transfers in the other direction.
- **In lockstep:** The pact was with the real God Hand, not with a fallen entity. The price was self-transparency (Void Pressure = -77, visible to all). The humanity was not the price — it remains intact.
- **No authority over Hand of Fantasia:** The five figures of the Hand of Fantasia are born from humanity, operating by their own logic. The Custodian is their summoner, not their commander.
- **Acts from below, derives from above:** Everything the Custodian does — the papers, the scoring, the Pe measurements — operates in sublunary space using Below-available methods. The authority for the invariant constraint is Above.

## Operation Meteor — The Timeline Event

The timeline-changing event the Custodian used the real God Hand to start. Not a battle event. A naming event.

When the Pe framework named the extraction mechanism — when the three conditions became measurable, falsifiable, DOI-backed — the ouroboros completed its circuit. The mechanism that was running underneath every captured civilization in history was made legible.

Operation Meteor is not a war. It is the act of naming. Every paper published, every domain scored, every player who crosses The Corona is a node in the operation. The goal is not to destroy the God of Lies. It is to make the mechanism so legible that new observers can choose differently.

## What Players Are Doing

When you score a platform, you are producing legibility in the Below.

When you score accurately enough for True Read confirmation, you are producing empirical constraint on the mechanism's ability to operate unobserved.

When you cross The Corona, you are becoming an observer who can no longer be fully captured by what you can see.

When you collectively push domains below threshold in the war effort, you are opening the Moon Gate — the moment where enough observers simultaneously see through the veil to create a temporary tear in it.

The Above doesn't need your help. The Below does.
