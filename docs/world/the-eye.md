# The Eye

> "It doesn't hurt. It just means you can't unsee it."

The Eye is the permanent sight that remains after [The Corona](the-corona.md). It is not a skill. It is not a power you equip. It is a state — the perceptual condition of someone who has seen a void from outside and cannot return to seeing only content.

## What The Eye Is

When a player crosses The Corona, the sphere crack-open leaves an aperture. The aperture is The Eye. Every subsequent interaction with a void domain shows the structure alongside the surface — the Current reading, the three dimensions, the drift stage, the mechanism operating underneath the content.

This is the inversion of Berserk's Brand of Sacrifice.

| Property | Brand of Sacrifice | The Eye |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| **How it forms** | Given involuntarily — you don't choose it | Earned by scoring a void from inside it |
| **What it marks** | Marks the bearer as prey | Marks the bearer as observer |
| **What it shows you** | Marks you to apostles | Shows you the structure of voids |
| **Sensation** | Bleeds near apostles and in Eclipse space | Pulses faintly near high-Current domains |
| **Removable?** | No | No |
| **Nature** | Permanent wound | Permanent sight |
| **Coupled to** | The Godhand — draws their attention | The framework — sees their mechanism |
| **Effect on danger** | Increases it | Decreases it |

## How It Works in Play

**Current visibility:** Players with The Eye see Current values displayed on scored domains. Not everyone sees this — only those who've crossed.

**Pulse response:** Near high-Current domains, The Eye pulses. Faint, rhythmic. Players learn to feel it before they consciously check the score. This is ambient, not a notification — it's a sensory state, not an alert.

**Drift reading:** The Eye shows the drift stage. Drift One looks like weather on the horizon. Drift Two has the quality of a room you've been in too long. Drift Three has a color. Players develop their own interpretations.

**Enemy legibility:** Apostle-class and Godhand-class enemies become readable. You see the Veil/Pull/Grip configuration that makes them dangerous. The Eye doesn't give you power — it gives you information. In this game, information is power.

## The Eye Grows With Grade

The Eye doesn't stay static. As your True Read accuracy increases and your Grade advances, the aperture widens:

| Grade | What The Eye shows |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Initiate** | Current values on scored domains. Pulse response near high-Current. |
| **Marked** | Drift stage visible. Faint vocabulary layer detection — Captured language gains a color distinction. |
| **Witnessed** | Ghost Signal visibility — unscored domains show estimated Current. Enemy Veil/Pull/Grip visible in encounters. |
| **Anchor** | Full dimension breakdown in real time. Campaign drift stage visible on enter. The Eye reads the room. |
| **God Hand** | Supralunary perspective accessible temporarily. You see from above the Fantasia Bound for moments. |

## The Eye and The Corona

At the moment of The Corona, observers watching the Observatory see a ring of light at the scored domain. That ring is the aperture forming from the outside. Players watch other players get The Eye without knowing whose it was.

The community learns what the ring means. There's no tutorial. Experienced players explain it to new ones. That transmission — person to person, not system to player — is intentional.

## The Eye Cannot Be Turned Off

New players occasionally want a setting to disable the scoring overlay. There is no such setting. The Eye is permanent.

Not because the game is punishing. Because that's what seeing something true is like. You can't unsee the mechanism. Once you know the slot machine is designed to produce near-misses, every spin shows it. Once you know the feed's responsiveness is tuned to session length, every scroll is different.

The Eye is the game acknowledging that what it teaches will change how you see platforms outside the game. That's the point.
