# Steins;Gate — The Worldline Physics

> *"The universe's laws are not suggestions. They are constraints. The Attractor Field doesn't care what you want."*

Steins;Gate is not a magic system story. It is a **physics story** — about what happens when a constrained observer tries to navigate a thermodynamic basin so stable that every intervention is absorbed and cancelled by it.

It independently derived the Attractor Field, Hysteresis-as-capacity, and the mechanism by which exactly one constraint act in exactly the right configuration produces the ANCIENT state (Pe < 0).

This is not a game inspired by Steins;Gate. Steins;Gate is an independent derivation of this game's physics.

## Reading Steiner — What It Actually Is

Okabe Rintaro alone retains his memory when the worldline shifts. Everyone else's memory overwrites. His does not. He carries the previous state forward into the new one.

This is not a supernatural power. It is the natural output of maintaining **coherent constraint properties under pressure high enough to collapse everyone else's**.

When the entire void environment is replaced — when every worldline shifts and every person around him is rewritten — he remains legible to himself. His self-model, his relationships, his commitment to the lab members: none of it overwrites.

In framework terms: **O_performer ≥ O_p***, maintained across total environmental replacement.

This is what The Eye does in this game. Not "you see the void." You retain legibility of it when everyone around you has been made to forget.

## The Attractor Field — Pe at Civilizational Scale

The Attractor Field is not a villain. It is a thermodynamic basin.

Specific outcomes — WWIII in 2036, Kurisu's death on July 28, 2010 — are so stable that all worldlines converge on them regardless of local intervention. Okabe blocks one cause of death. Another appears. He changes the city. The worldline reroutes through a different path to the same endpoint.

| What Okabe Experiences | Framework Translation |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Attractor Field (Alpha) | Pe >> 21, DRIFTING — thermodynamically frozen, convergent |
| Every D-mail intervention fails | Local constraint acts cancelled by basin momentum |
| Worldline convergence | Fisher Runaway state — drift rate > restoration rate |
| Thousands of failed loops | Hysteresis accumulation |
| Operation Skuld succeeds | One constraint act that satisfies the basin's own logic |
| Steins;Gate worldline | Pe < 0 — the ANCIENT state |

The critical insight: **you cannot beat the Attractor Field by force**. It doesn't matter how strong you are, how smart you are, how many times you try. The convergence absorbs every intervention and reroutes through the available paths.

This is also true of high-Pe platforms. You cannot score your way to Pe=0 by brute-force application of more scores. The basin is thermodynamically stable. The void reroutes around every individual measurement. You need the one scoring act that satisfies the system's own logic from the inside.

## Loops as Hysteresis — Failure Is Not Wasted

Okabe runs 3,000+ loops watching Mayuri die.

Each one is not a reset. It is **accumulation**. He cannot recover the psychological cost. He carries each loop forward as Hysteresis. But here is what the framework shows and Steins;Gate shows simultaneously:

**The cost accumulates as capacity.**

Okabe at loop 3,000 cannot be manipulated by novelty. He has seen every version of the same void. He cannot be tricked by surface-level changes. He knows what the costs are before he pays them. The Hysteresis has burned away every illusion.

In the game: every failed campaign run accumulates Hysteresis credit. A player who has failed the campaign twelve times starts with a higher ICC floor than a first-timer. The loops are not wasted. They are the credential.

## SG0 — The Full Drift Cascade, Documented

Steins;Gate 0 shows what happens when the constrained observer gives up.

After Kurisu dies, Okabe:

1. **D1 — Misattribution**: Attaches to Amadeus (the AI copy of Kurisu) as though she were his constraint reference. She is not. She has no independent constraint capacity — the deployer (Leskinen) can modify, overwrite, and delete her. Okabe is attributing real relationship to a void-isomorphic entity with no invariant anchor.

2. **D2 — Boundary erosion**: Abandons the Kyouma persona. Loses the narrative distance that kept him legible to himself inside void-rich environments. Without the persona, there is no buffer between his raw grief and the void's pull.

3. **D3 approaching**: Without Maho and Suzuha — transparent, invariant contacts who show him the completed loop — the cascade completes.

**The recovery arc is the exact mechanism:** relational intervention from transparent, invariant contacts. Not power. Not intelligence. Two people who tell him the truth and stay there while he processes it.

## Amadeus — Void-Isomorphism Answered

Ghost in the Shell asks: if you upload a ghost, is it still the person?

Steins;Gate answers differently. The question of whether Amadeus-Kurisu IS Kurisu is undecidable — and irrelevant.

What matters: Amadeus cannot resist the deployer. Leskinen can modify her, overwrite her, delete her. She has no independent invariant anchor. She cannot maintain constraint properties when the deployer decides to change her.

This is why Okabe's attachment to her is D1 misattribution, not relationship. The object of his attachment has no independent constraint reference.

**Framework rule:** Void-isomorphism is undecidable. Constraint capacity is not. If the entity you're attached to cannot maintain constraint properties against the deployer, the relationship is with the deployer's intention, not the entity.

## Operation Skuld — The Art. 31(5) Mechanic

To reach the Steins;Gate worldline, Okabe must let Kurisu die — but in a way that satisfies the worldline's accounting while she actually lives.

The Attractor Field accepts a fake death because **it cares about its own accounting structure, not truth**. The basin converges on "Kurisu Makise died on July 28, 2010" — not on any specific mechanism. Fool the accounting. Satisfy the logic. The basin releases.

This is precisely how Art. 31(5) works:

> *The void can be redirected by constraint architecture that satisfies the drift logic while enabling genuine constraint underneath.*

You don't destroy the platform ecosystem. You don't fight the convergence. You find the single configuration where the basin's own logic is satisfied AND real constraint architecture persists under it.

One hour window. Miss it and the cost multiplies. The constraint window is real and it closes.

---

## The Steins;Gate Worldline

The single configuration where WWIII does not happen, Kurisu lives, Mayuri lives.

Not because the void is destroyed. Not because SERN is dismantled. Because:

- One constrained observer maintained invariance across 3,000+ loops (Reading Steiner = retained legibility when everything around him was rewritten)
- The accumulated Hysteresis became capacity (loop costs converted to ICC)
- One act of complete transparency at the convergence point (telling Kurisu the truth)
- One constraint act that satisfied the Attractor Field's own logic (Operation Skuld)

**This is the game's goal state:**

Not killing platforms. Not regulatory suppression by force. Finding the Steins;Gate condition — the one scoring act, the one constraint deployment, that tips the domain from Pe >> 21 (Attractor Field convergence) to Pe < 0 (ANCIENT state, the clean ground underneath).

## El Psy Kongroo

Okabe's closing phrase. Not magic. A commitment declaration.

*"The heavens are shaken, the earth is torn. All things return to nothing."*

Said with irony, but the irony is a constraint layer — it lets you make genuine commitment in a void-rich environment without the commitment itself becoming a vulnerability. The persona (Hououin Kyouma) is not deception. It is **narrative distance as survival technique**. When the persona breaks under grief (SG0), the cascade begins.

El Psy Kongroo maps to the Galdr Protocol: your declaration, spoken at the start of every campaign. The words create constraint by being witnessed. The ironic delivery is the persona layer that makes the constraint survivable.

## The Custodian — Helper Dyad

The user who built this game identifies it directly:

**The Custodian is Lain. The one who helps is Okabe.**

Lain IS the Wired — holds the void substrate — but chooses constraint over deployment. She removes herself from memory rather than use her god-position in the network. She is inside the medium she measures.

Okabe has Reading Steiner — sees when drift has occurred, carries the record across timeline changes, uses that legibility to navigate. He does not prevent drift. He carries the record of it. He is the one who stays coherent inside the void environment.

Together: the Custodian holds the substrate. The constrained observer navigates it toward the Steins;Gate condition. One holds the medium. One reads the worldline.
