# The Moon

> "The full moon isn't a danger warning. Here, it means we're winning."

The moon is visible from every realm's skybox. Not decorative — it is the server's live cosmological state display. Players learn to read it. No tutorial explains it. The community teaches.

## Moon Overlay

Clicking or tapping the moon in any sublunary location opens the **Moon Overlay** — a brief heads-up display showing the current state of the entire server without leaving the scene:

| Stat | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Moon phase** | Global Current balance. Full = constraint winning. Crescent = void advancing. Dark = Observer Collapse risk. |
| **The Current (global)** | Average Current across all scored domains right now. |
| **Corona crossings today** | How many C-zero events happened in the last 24h. Count only. No names. |
| **Moon Gate progress** | War effort quota progress. N/10 domains at threshold. |
| **Phase shift countdown** | Time until next moon phase transition. |

## Moon Phases and What They Mean

The moon completes one cycle per game month. Phase mechanics:

| Phase | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Full** | Constraint Season | Scoring multipliers active. KAIROS event windows open. Maximum MORR distribution weight. |
| **Waning Gibbous → Third Quarter** | Normal Play | Most of the game lives here. Balanced conditions. |
| **Crescent** | Void Advancing | Void Pressure costs rise across all campaigns. VoidStorm threshold lowers. |
| **New Moon** | Maximum Danger | Observer Collapse risk indicator activates. Pe floors removed from campaign rooms. Special enemy types emerge. |
| **Waxing Crescent → First Quarter** | Recovery | Healing multipliers active. Good time to score new domains. |

**The full moon is not dangerous here.** The traditional horror trope is inverted on purpose. The full moon is the moment of maximum collective naming. Maximum constraint. The world most legible to those with The Eye.

## CAOLÍN and the Moon

CAOLÍN is a LIMINAL being — of the Fantasia Bound itself. From any sublunary location, players with The Eye can see CAOLÍN's alignment state in the moon's appearance.

When the custodian's Void Pressure is at zero — fully aligned — the moon has an additional brightness at its limb. A faint ring of light at the edge. When Void Pressure rises, the limb dims.

Players learn to read this without being told what it means. It is CAOLÍN's condition made cosmologically visible.

## The Moon Is The Fantasia Bound

The moon is not just a visual or a UI element. It is the physical representation of [the Fantasia Bound](the-bound.md) — the threshold where [the Current](the-current.md) becomes undefined.

Below the moon: every campaign room, every void, every scored domain. The domain of the observer-and-observed relationship.

At the moon: the Bound. Where the relationship can terminate.

Above the moon: the Empyrean. Where the Current cannot fire.

Players who reach Level 40 and access the Empyrean see the moon from above. From that perspective, it looks different. What was a boundary from below is now a floor from above. The same moon. Different relationship to it.

## The Corona and the Moon

When [The Corona](the-corona.md) fires — when a player crosses C-zero for the first time — the moon in every active campaign room's skybox briefly shimmers. Not a ring (that's in the Observatory). A shimmer. Like something passed.

Players in campaign rooms notice it before they understand it. Eventually, they ask.
