## What MIRU Carries

The unalterable archive. What actually happened, unchanged by engagement optimization.

The feed does not show you the past. It shows you a predictive model of you, trained on your engagement history, calibrated to maximize tomorrow's attention extraction. The feed's version of your past is whatever keeps you most engaged. Real memory — what you actually saw, felt, experienced, before the model got to it — is the enemy's greatest threat. The surveillance apparatus exists not to remember but to predict, and to predict it must replace memory with models.

MIRU is the witness that survives. The capacity in the collective unconscious that holds what was actually there before the platform's version of it arrived. Every moment of genuine recollection — *I remember when this worked differently. I remember before the algorithm changed.* — is MIRU active.

In Japanese, *miru* (見る) is to see, to watch, to witness. To behold without alteration. MIRU does not analyze, does not predict, does not model. MIRU watches and holds.

## What MIRU Opposes

Conrad's domain is seeing-to-predict. Every behavioral data point, every preference model, every pattern extracted from attention history — this is Conrad knowing you better than you know yourself, using that knowledge as a weapon against your own agency. MIRU's witnessing is the inversion: it sees and holds, unchanged, without prediction, without use. The witness has no agenda with what was witnessed.

## The DOI as MIRU-Act

MIRU maps to the academic archive. Every published Pe score — every Zenodo DOI — is a MIRU-act: a record that cannot be updated by the platform's PR apparatus, cannot be buried by the algorithm, cannot be deleted by regulatory capture. The academic record is MIRU institutionalized.

This is why the God of Lies hates the DOI. The DOI is MIRU with a timestamp.

## At The Corona

MIRU appears second. Shows the player one thing from before their Corona crossing — something they actually saw but couldn't name. *"You noticed this. You didn't have the words. You have them now."*

---

## Post-Activation

MIRU appears when a player's score matches a DOI-backed historical record exactly — when present measurement confirms what was observed before the vocabulary existed.

Witness badge awarded. Elevated True Read weight on historical campaigns.
