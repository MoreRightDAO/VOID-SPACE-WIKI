# Twilight of Fantasia

**The game where the scoring is real.**

Every platform you score has a live Pe measurement — The Current — backed by published, peer-reviewed research with a DOI. Every campaign you run corresponds to a real extraction architecture operating in the world. Every ICC-accepted score you submit is a named mechanism in a permanent academic record.

The void is real. The naming dissolves it. This is the game.

-   **The Current**

    ---

    What Pe is. The measure of how hard a void pulls. Why it matters. How to read it.

-   **The Corona**

    ---

    The moment you first see the void you've been inside. The annular eclipse. The sphere cracks open.

-   **The Hand of Fantasia**

    ---

    Five post-Jungian figures born from humanity's act of naming. They were inside the void the whole time.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Meet them](figures/index.md)

-   **The Enemy**

    ---

    Ten agents of the God of Lies. Five named, five emerging. The void architectures that run on your attention.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Know them](enemy/index.md)

-   **Archetypes**

    ---

    Lion. Ox. Eagle. Human. Revealed at The Corona — not chosen. The capacity you already had.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Find yours](archetypes/index.md)

-   **Glossary**

    ---

    The Current, True Read, The Eye, Drift One/Two/Three, Clear/Clouded/Captured. All the terms.

## The premise

The God of Lies built an extraction architecture across the human information layer. Platforms optimized for maximum attention capture — high Veil (opacity), high Pull (reactivity), high Grip (coupling). The mechanism was made invisible so it could run without opposition.

The void framework made the mechanism measurable. Pe — The Current — is the number. Every scored platform has one. Every number is citable, peer-reviewed, permanent.

The game is played inside the real world because the voids being scored are real voids. You cannot name TikTok from outside TikTok. The scoring happens from inside. The Pe meter runs while you're in the campaign.

This is the AUG layer. The game board is the world.

## Chapter I: The Ring of Light

*Season 1 — The war effort begins.*

The framework named the mechanism. The papers are in the permanent record. The God of Lies' architecture — the extraction system running on every major attention platform — is now measurable, falsifiable, and citable.

That's what changed. Not the voids. Not the enemy roster. The voids have been running for decades. The enemy was in the field before the first player arrived. What changed is that the mechanism is now legible — three numbers, twenty-six kill conditions, zero triggered.

**The Ring of Light** is what players see when someone crosses The Corona anywhere in the world: a brief annular ring flaring around the domain they scored, visible in the Observatory for thirty seconds. The void's outline, made visible. Then gone.

Season 1 is every player arriving to see that ring for themselves — and then staying to make more of them.

Ten campaigns are live. The Hand of Fantasia has appeared. Every domain scored reduces the Current. Every True Read is a permanent entry in the naming record. The moon tracks the collective state of the war.

The war effort has begun. The gate is not open yet. The Godhand Five are waiting.
