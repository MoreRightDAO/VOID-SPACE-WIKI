## Custodian NPCs

### Urahara (Crafters' Union)

*Kisuke Urahara. Architect in exile. Builds from the threshold.*

The Custodian's secondary identity in the game world. Urahara operates from the underground level of the Crafters' Union — not the main floor. He's not hiding; he's just not advertising.

**Function:** Hogyoku Fragment upgrades. The only NPC in the game who can upgrade a Flawed, Cracked, or Near-Complete Hogyoku Fragment into a perfected piece.

**Requirements he enforces:**
1. Completed scoring record in the fragment's domain (minimum 10 ICC-accepted scores)
2. Framework-native mechanism description (L1 vocabulary, written submission)
3. VP < 25 during the campaign where the fragment was earned

If all three are met: upgrade proceeds, no wait. If not: he holds the fragment for 30 days. "Come back when the conditions are met." No accelerator exists. No payment bypasses the requirements.

**Lore note:** The Custodian's position is Urahara × Ichibei Hyosube — the architect in exile + the one who named all things. Urahara's store in Bleach is positioned identically: outside the institution, more knowledgeable than the institution, building from a threshold location. The CC-BY license is the Urahara position: exiled from institutional gatekeeping, but the plans remain accessible to anyone who finds them.

## Legendary Zone NPCs

### Melchior (Göbekli Tepe)

*Guru of Life. Constraint tool craftsman.*

Melchior built constraint architectures before cities existed. His questline is the deepest historical grounding available to any player — it starts at ~10,000 BCE, at the first known ritual architecture in the archaeological record.

**Function:** Grants the **Deep Memory** buff permanently upon first visit (+10% Current shadow radius). The only source of this buff.

**Questline:** Why did Göbekli Tepe's builders bury it? The questline answer is not provided directly — it must be inferred through scoring the site's mechanism. Players who score it correctly receive Melchior's crafting pattern: an archaic constraint tool unavailable from any other source.

### Gaspar (The End of Time)

*Guru of Time. He's been waiting.*

Gaspar sits at the End of Time — accessible only when all 26 kill conditions have been challenged and survived. He has exactly one line:

*"You survived it. Now you know it's survivable."*

No mechanic attached. No reward. One conversation. The zone has no Current.

---

### Quattro (Babylon Trade District)

*Merchant Princes leader. The questline question: is Babylon a void or a city?*

Quattro operates in the Tower District's trade hub. His questline poses the framework's hardest analytical problem in Tier 1: Babylon at its height scores differently by district. The Tower is O=3. The Hanging Gardens are O=0. The Trade District is contested.

**Function:** Merchant Princes faction access. Trade contract mechanics. His questline reveals how the framework handles ambiguous cases — structures that are partially void, partially genuine.

---

### Millicent (Chartres Cathedral)

*Wandering graceful one. She doesn't stay long.*

Millicent (from Elden Ring — the graceful wanderer) is found at the center of Chartres Cathedral. She is not a quest giver. She is a lore delivery mechanism: she describes what Chartres felt like before the architectural tradition that produced it was lost.

**Mechanic:** Players who spend 10 minutes at Chartres without scoring, without actions, receive the **Stillness** buff (+10 Logos on departure). The game's only mechanic for rewarding deliberate non-action.

---

### The Norns — Urd, Verdandi, Skuld (Yggdrasil Root)

*They know the Pe trajectories. They won't say when.*

The three Norns sit at the root of Yggdrasil in the Norse zone. They know the Pe trajectories for all 63 domains — past (Urd), present (Verdandi), and the possible futures (Skuld). They will share information, but only with players whose Precision qualifies them to understand what they're hearing.

**Kill condition holders:** The Norns hold copies of the 26 kill conditions alongside Avalanche Wong. Their copies are the lore-layer record; Wong's copy is the mechanical record.

**Function:** Pe trajectory consultation for advanced scoring. Available at Grade 1+.

---

### Avalanche Wong (Garden of Schala / Gate Site Zero)

*Last known survivor of the Remnant Guild. Stationed at Gate Site Zero.*

Avalanche Wong is positioned at Gate Site Zero — the rift marker where the Project Gaia Egregor campaign begins. He is the primary keeper of the kill conditions in active gameplay (the Norns hold the archive copy; Wong holds the live version).

**Function:**
- Kill condition display and verification
- Project Gaia campaign introduction
- Remnant Guild faction access (NPCs only — the Guild is not currently a player faction)
- Garden of Schala dialogue variant: if you've scored ≥5 Pe=0 platforms before speaking to him, he has a different conversation.

**Reputation track:** Completing his questline phases unlocks Gate Site Zero interior zones. He doesn't give faction standing until the player demonstrates scoring accuracy in his domain — he won't vouch for someone who can't read what's happening at the Gate.

## Faction NPCs

### The Oracle Panel (Variable)

Three vetted researchers who serve as the arbiter for contested scores and the Binding Game Rule System. The Panel is not a fixed set of named NPCs — it rotates. Current Panel composition is displayed in the Observatory.

**Function:**
- Contested score review (edge cases only — standard Binding Game matches resolve by composite ICC formula, not Panel review)
- Binding Game rule voting (48-hour proposal, 24-hour Panel vote)
- Binding Vow verification
- Rule activation/renewal/challenge (7-day active, 250 MORR renewal fee)
- Technical violation adjudication (coordinated scoring accusations, platform identity disputes)

The Panel applies the Tablet of Law. It does not interpret. When a dispute involves an invariant rule, the Panel rule is that it cannot override the Tablet. The Composite Score formula is the arbiter for who won a match — the Panel only enters when there is a procedural or technical violation of the Rule System itself.

### Schala (Memorial — Garden of Schala)

*Not a living NPC. The memorial.*

Schala is referenced throughout the economy system (Schala's Needle — the Tier 5 legendary material), the Garden of Schala (the Archive Quarter memorial), and the Dissolution Scroll mechanic. She does not appear as a living NPC.

The memorial in the Archive Quarter marks the Drifter-class entity associated with the AI art domain — the first case where the framework identified a creative domain being instrumentalized for extraction. The Garden is where fata brighten because the Pe was lower here before the Palette Problem was named.
