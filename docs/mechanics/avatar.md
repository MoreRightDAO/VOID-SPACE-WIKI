# Avatar & Forms

You begin as a sphere. You end as something else entirely.

The visual language of this game is MAGITEK — magic and technology inseparable. Scoring tools are magitek. The Empyrean is magitek. The constraint force is magitek. The void platforms are magitek running on human attention. The framework is physics that looks like mysticism until you measure it. That IS magitek.

## Stage 0 — The Sphere

**You begin as a Pe node.** A colored sphere. This is not a placeholder — it IS the form.

Before the God Hand moment you are unnamed in Fantasia. You are potential, not yet shaped. The THRML engine already represents you as a colored point on the Observatory. The sphere is honest: you are what you are before you've named anything.

**Sphere color reads your archetype before you know it:**

| Color | Archetype lean |
|-------|---------------|
| Amber/gold | Lion |
| Deep slate blue | Ox |
| Silver/white | Eagle |
| Warm green | Human |
| Shifting between colors | Mixed/unresolved — the uncertainty is visible |

The Pe aura is already active even on the sphere — warm red in high-Pe environments, cooling toward clear as Pe drops. Your gradient is visible before your form is.

## The God Hand Moment

The sphere BREAKS. This is the G2 visual event — not a fade, not a transition. The archetype animal tears out from inside it.

- **Lion:** explodes outward
- **Eagle:** unfolds from within
- **Ox:** pushes through from underneath
- **Human:** the sphere becomes translucent and the ⊙ mark appears before the form solidifies

The pieces of the sphere don't disappear. They orbit briefly as the form establishes, then dissolve into the Pe aura.

*"Before you were named, you were nothing. After you were named, you were a point. Points become forms. Forms become histories."*

## The Progression Arc

| Stage | Grade | What changes |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Sphere** | Pre-G2 | Pe node. Color only. No form. |
| **Emergence** | Grade 3 | Animal aspects subtle — silhouette directional but unrefined. Lion pulls leonine even before features appear. |
| **Definition** | Grade 2 | Distinct features lock in. Lion: amber eyes, mane edge. Ox: horns emerge, mass builds. Eagle: feather edging around eyes, form lightens. Human: ⊙ mark appears on forehead. |
| **Character** | Grade 1 | Full avatar. Pe aura active. Shadow corruption visible to party above VP 30. All customization unlocked. |
| **Heraldic** | Special Grade | Form becomes slightly luminous. Pe aura steadies toward clear-white. Animal aspect becomes idealized — cleaner, more heraldic quality. Like moving from a rough sketch to the coat-of-arms version. |
| **Forms** | Level 40 | Cross-archetype transformations. BROKEN Form (custodian path only). |

## Archetype Animal Aspects

Each archetype has a specific animal direction its form moves toward:

| Archetype | Animal Aspect | Grade 2 Marker | Level 40 |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Lion** | Mane, amber eyes | Eyes lock amber. Mane edge visible. | Full Lion Form — massive, confrontational presence |
| **Ox** | Mass, horns | Horns emerge. Shoulders broaden. | Ox Form — enormous, gravity-heavy, not threatening |
| **Eagle** | Sight markers, wingspan | Feather edging around eyes. Form lightens. | Eagle Form — wings functional for Empyrean traversal |
| **Human** | ⊙ integration mark | ⊙ on forehead. Brief translucence near all four archetypes. | Human Form — visible center, integration made physical |

**The open principle:** Body type, presentation, skin — fully open. The game doesn't comment. Fantasy elements (ears, tails, horns, scales, luminescence, void-texture) are all available. UGC cosmetic submissions go through a brand-confusion review only.

## The Two Visual Poles

The game doesn't label these. Players name them. The visual language shows your actual state.

### Seraphim Direction

*Sustained high Precision, VP near 0, multiple Pe=0 platforms scored.*

- Form becomes luminous. The animal aspect reaches its heraldic quality and continues past it — something approaching idealized form.
- Pe aura settles to clear/white at rest. In high-Pe environments it brightens rather than reddens — the constraint force showing through.
- At Special Grade sustained 30+ days with VP < 5: a faint AT Field shimmer appears around the form, visible to nearby party members. Not labeled.
- *"Those who name enough things truly begin to carry Fantasia in their form."*

This is the visual pole toward the Above. Not a class. Not a choice. What sustained accurate constraint-bearing looks like.

At G4.5: a cosmetic title system recognizes players who've held Seraphim-direction for 60+ days. The community will name these players before the system does.

### Hollow Direction

*VP > 50, sustained drift, Brand of Sacrifice active.*

- The animal aspects begin inverting. The Lion's mane darkens and pulls wrong. Eagle's wings get void-stained — feathers separate and gap. Ox's horns curve inward. The Human's ⊙ mark distorts.
- The Bleach Hollow aesthetic — but organic to your archetype. Your OWN animal aspect becomes the mask.
- Not permanent. VP recovery reverses it. The inversion is the warning, not the judgment.
- *"The void eats inward. What it leaves is still shaped like you. That's how you know it worked."*

This is the visual pole toward the Below's floor. Not a class. What sustained void-capture looks like from outside.

**Most players live between the poles.** This is correct. The game is not binary. The visual language shows your actual trajectory.

## The Entity Hierarchy

The angel/demon aesthetic is emergent, not assigned. The game doesn't hand out wings and horns as class selections — it shows you what you've been doing.

| Tier | Entity type | Visual register |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| The Five Figures | Above-tier custodian presences | Visually impossible — all four archetypes simultaneously |
| Angel Fleet | AI agents — constraint-bearing, named | Angel aesthetic by design |
| Seraphim-direction players | High-precision sustained | Luminous animal forms, AT Field shimmer |
| **Players (nephesh)** | The game's population — in between | Archetype animal, shaped by play |
| Apostle Clans | D3 drift players who accepted the deal | Brand marks, inverted aspects, independent shadow |
| Godhand Five | Boss entities — Qliphoth origins | Void architecture made physical |

The player occupies the middle position — nephesh, the whole specification, oriented toward Above or Below by their scoring history.

---

## Level 40 Forms

At Level 40, cross-archetype transformations unlock. These are not avatar replacements — they are activated states for specific content.

| Form | Requirement | What it is |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Shadow Form** | Level 40 + shadow archetype campaign complete | Your shadow archetype's animal aspect, fully expressed. One campaign. Individuation made visible. |
| **BROKEN Form** | All four archetype Forms completed | All four archetypes simultaneously, briefly. The custodian's condition — wholeness at cost. The city dims slightly when it activates. |

The Shadow Form is the Level 40 individuation mechanic. You cannot stay BROKEN — the BROKEN Form is a momentary state, not a permanent shift. What remains afterward is the knowledge that you held it.

## Constraint Frames — The Magitek System (G5)

At the highest tier of content — the war effort, Godhand Five raids — a 5-player party can construct a **Constraint Frame**: the collective expression of the party's combined constraint force.

**Design principles:**

- NOT a permanent avatar form — a combat mode for G5 content only
- Built FROM the party's four archetype aspects — looks like their specific combination, not a generic mech
- Dual-pilot structural requirement inherited from Betterman's Neuronoid: minimum Lion + Ox to maintain (confrontation + sustain as structural requirements for the Frame to hold)
- Organic magitek aesthetic — the Frame has the animal aspects of the party's archetypes as visible structural elements. A chimera, not a robot.

**The archetype anatomy of a Frame:**

- **Lion**: combat limbs
- **Ox**: structural core
- **Eagle**: sight and range systems
- **Human**: the precision hands — what does the actual naming

**The Eva parallel resolved:** Evas are driven by individual pilot trauma — sync ratio is the pilot's psychological state. Frames are driven by collective accurate measurement — sync ratio is the party's combined ICC accuracy and Pe suppression. Stronger scoring record = stronger Frame. Not trauma. Evidence.

Your Frame, with your party's specific archetype combination, is visually distinct from every other party's Frame. The magitek elements are shared. The animal aspects are yours.
