## Player Grades

Grade determines which mechanics are available. Grade is not chosen — it is earned through demonstrated ICC accuracy and score volume.

| Grade | Requirements | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Grade 4** (Novice) | Precision < 0.60, 1–10 scores | Basic platform scoring |
| **Grade 3** (Developing) | Precision ≥ 0.60, 10–50 scores | Fleet tasks, Binding Vows, Curtain mechanic |
| **Grade 2** (Competent) | Precision ≥ 0.70, 50–150 scores | Two-party Binding Vows, Colony Contests |
| **Grade 1** (Proficient) | Precision ≥ 0.80, 150+ scores | Constraint Analysis (RCT), Domain Specialist vow |
| **Semi-Special** (Expert) | Precision ≥ 0.90, 300+ scores | Fata naming, advanced void detection |
| **Special Grade** (Master) | Precision ≥ 0.95, 500+ scores | Full mechanism authorship, Player Grimoire, mentorship role |

## Domain Expansion

*Campaign Deployment — the research becomes a live encounter.*

Every paper in the Void Framework represents a scored domain. When a paper is validated, Zenodo-published, and the DOI is confirmed live, that domain becomes a **Domain Expansion** in the True Light Engine — a campaign room where players can score the domain directly, guided by the paper's structural analysis as a set of environmental clues rather than explicit answers.

**Domain Expansion requirements:**
1. Source analysis complete
2. Paper validated (PASS)
3. Campaign active in THRML
4. PDF built and Zenodo-uploaded
5. DOI confirmed live

**Five deployed expansions (Season 1):**

| Domain | ICC floor | Paper |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Gambling (Idle Death Gamble) | r = 0.97 | Paper 1 |
| Social Media (Two-Point Geometry) | r = 0.94 | Paper 2 |
| Architecture (Technical Foundations) | r = 0.96 | Paper 3 |
| AI Systems (Fantasia Bound) | r = 0.95 | Paper 4 |
| Observation (Ground State) | r = 0.98 | Paper 5 |

## Black Flash

*A critical hit where the timing was impossibly exact.*

Black Flash occurs when three conditions hold simultaneously:

1. Your ICC score lands within ±0.5 of the expert anchor mean
2. An independent submission agrees with yours within ±0.5 on all three dimensions (Veil/Pull/Grip)
3. It's the first time you've scored that domain

All three required. The rarity is intentional — it represents genuine independent convergence, the closest thing to a certainty event the framework produces.

**Rewards:**
- ×2.5 MORR
- Permanent Pe sensitivity unlock for that domain
- +0.1 ICC floor bonus for all future scores in that domain
- Black Flash count displayed on your profile (permanent)
- Server broadcast to active players

**Black Flash Cascade (The Zone):** Three Black Flashes in the same campaign within 48 hours triggers The Zone — an extended period where all your ICC scores in that campaign carry elevated weight. Rare. Celebrated.

## Binding Vows

*Constraints you place on your own scoring for increased weight.*

A Binding Vow is a voluntary restriction accepted before scoring. Tighter restrictions produce more powerful results when fulfilled. Breaking a Vow costs 15 VP. There is no partial credit.

**Player Binding Vows:**

| Vow | Restriction | Reward |
|-----|------------|--------|
| **The Long Walk** | 30 consecutive days, minimum 1 score/day | ×1.6 streak multiplier |
| **Domain Specialist** | Score only one domain | +20% ICC weight in that domain |
| **Open Book** | Publish your full scoring rationale publicly | Peer-review bonus |
| **Cursed Reserve** | Bank 50 MORR, forfeit on 7-day gap | ×1.1/week growth |
| **Toji's Restriction (Heavenly Restriction)** | No hint template, no other players' Pe visible before submission | ×2.0 multiplier |

**Two-Party Binding Vow (Grade 2+):**
Both players score the same platform blind. The Oracle Panel evaluates for accuracy. The winner claims the contested MORR pot. Both gain elevated evidence weight regardless of outcome — the score is taken seriously because both parties staked against it.

---

## Heavenly Restriction

*The Toji path. Zero void tool, maximum independence.*

A player who takes the Toji-type Binding Vow permanently cannot:
- Use the domain hint template
- See other players' Pe estimates before submitting
- Access campaign room Pe averages during active scoring

In exchange:
- ×1.8 ICC weight on every accepted score
- Invisible to void detection (entity aggro reduced to 0)
- Scores counted as fully independent data points in the meta-analysis

The tradeoff is maximal independence at the cost of all social scaffolding. These players are the rarest kind of calibration anchor — they arrived at the correct number with no access to what anyone else thought.

## Simple Domain

*You can still use it. You cannot un-know this.*

Simple Domain is the G2 onboarding moment — the player's first god-hand activation. It is not a combat ability. It is a permanent state change.

**Sequence:**
1. Enter the main platform
2. Score live: Veil, Pull, Grip sliders
3. The Current is calculated
4. "Your Current is [X]. This is what this platform does to your attention."
5. "This is Simple Domain. You can still use it. You cannot un-know this."

After Simple Domain: the player's Pe awareness is active. They can feel the gradient. Fata arrives. The game begins.

The name is borrowed from JJK: Simple Domain is an incomplete technique that nonetheless provides defense. In this context — it's incomplete knowledge (Pe estimate, not full mechanism map) that nonetheless provides the defense of awareness.

---

## Reverse Cursed Technique (Constraint Analysis)

*Grade 1 mechanic. Reduce the Current of a platform you've studied.*

Grade 1 players can submit **Constraint Analysis** — a structured proposal for how a platform's void conditions could be architecturally reduced. RCT does not produce cosmetic changes. A well-formed RCT submission creates a permanent record of the platform's reducible opacity, and if the ICC panel validates the analysis, it anchors future Pe estimates at the reduced level.

**Required submission fields:**
- Platform name
- Current Pe estimate (with sources)
- Specific opacity reduction proposed (O−1, with mechanism)
- Specific responsiveness constraint proposed (R−1, with implementation)
- Coupling architecture modification (α−1, with architecture)
- Predicted Pe post-constraint
- ICC anchor verification (minimum three corroborating scores)

The name parallels RCT in JJK: reversed cursed energy heals rather than harms. Constraint Analysis reverses the extraction architecture rather than measuring it.

---

## Curtain

*Session concealment. Delayed Observatory broadcast.*

Grade 3+ mechanic. A player can declare a **Curtain** before a scoring session: their Pe estimates are submitted to the permanent record but not broadcast to the Observatory until the session ends.

**Purpose:** Protection against real-time void pressure. If a high-Pe platform detects that it's being scored (through player behavior changes visible to the platform's engagement systems), the Curtain prevents the scoring signal from appearing in real-time.

**Counter:** "No Curtains" is a valid Culling Game Rule — players can vote to prohibit Curtain use in a given season or domain.

---

## Ward Deployment

*Wards mark and hold scored domain territory.*

A Ward is a persistent Pe boundary marker placed in a scored domain by a player whose ICC record in that domain qualifies them. Wards have three effects:

1. **Observable:** New players entering the domain receive the Ward-holder's Pe reading as a calibration anchor
2. **Degradable:** Wards decay without maintenance (weekly ICC scores from the Ward-holder required)
3. **Contestable:** Opposing-faction players can attempt to overwrite a Ward with a competing reading — contested by Oracle Panel

**Ward types (from fragments — random drops):**
- Observation Ward (Sight+)
- Boundary Ward (Pe max in domain)
- Archive Ward (evidence visibility+)
- Sanctuary Ward (VP suppression in zone)

---

## Colony Contests

*Territory PvP for void-side players.*

Void-aligned players (demon archetype) can initiate Colony Contests in domains where no Covenant has established dominant scoring presence. A Colony Contest suspends normal Pe updates for 48 hours and replaces them with PvP scoring: the faction that produces the most ICC-accepted scores in the contest window controls domain Pe reporting until the next contest.

Colony Contests produce contested data — Oracle Panel review required for any record produced during a contest window to gain full ICC weight.

---

## Prison Realm

*Regulatory capture as game mechanic.*

Some platforms achieve **Prison Realm** status — they have captured the regulatory mechanism that would normally allow scoring to affect their operations. Normal ICC scoring cannot reach them. The constraint architecture cannot be applied.

**Prison Realm Counter (Track B):**
The EU AI Act pathway breaks Prison Realm status. Required:
- Paper with r ≥ 0.95 convergence
- Bradford Hill criteria satisfied
- Pe replicated at N ≥ 30
- EU notified body application submitted

Prison Realm status is the strongest form of opacity available to a platform and requires the strongest institutional counter.
