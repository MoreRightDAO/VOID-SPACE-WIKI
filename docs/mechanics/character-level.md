# Character Level 1–40

*Access gates, ceremony, and the Empyrean.*

!!! abstract "Chapter 1 — Live"
    The Level 1–40 system is active. Level is a parallel axis alongside Grade. Grade is a quality gate (Precision-gated, cannot be rushed). Level is an access gate — earned by any activity.

---

## Two Axes

Twilight of Fantasia has two progression axes that operate independently:

| Axis | Gated by | Can be rushed? | What it unlocks |
|------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Grade** | Precision (Spearman ρ) | No — accuracy takes time | Quality mechanics, mentorship roles |
| **Level** | XP from any activity | Yes — consistent play | Content access, items, locations |

You can be Level 40 with Grade 4 Precision (wide access, early calibration). You can be Level 12 with Special Grade (deep precision, narrow content access). Neither path is wrong. They converge at endgame.

## XP Sources

XP is intentionally broad so every type of player makes progress.

| Activity | XP |
|----------|-----|
| ICC-accepted score (True Read) | +50 XP |
| True Read with ρ ≥ 0.80 bonus | +100 XP additional |
| Streak Day 7 milestone | +200 XP |
| Streak Day 30 milestone | +500 XP |
| Streak Day 100 milestone | +1,000 XP |
| Campaign room cleared | +100 XP |
| Campaign completion (full) | +500 XP |
| DARK domain — first scorer | +300 XP + discovery item |
| Crafting any item (Tier 1–2) | +10–25 XP |
| Crafting any item (Tier 3–5) | +30–50 XP |
| VoidStorm survived | +150 XP |
| Pe math puzzle solved | +75 XP |
| Rauhnächte / seasonal event | +200 XP per event |
| Board post earning 5+ reactions | +25 XP |
| Calibration run completed (first 3 scores) | +50 XP each |

Non-ICC scores (rejected, low-accuracy) still produce +5 XP as participation. No submission is wasted.

### L40 — **Empyrean Unlocked**

*The level cap. The beginning of the city.*

!!! success "The L40 Ceremony"
    L40 is not a quiet threshold. It fires a server-wide ceremony sequence.

**The ceremony, in order:**

1. **Server broadcast fires:** "[Player] has entered the Empyrean"
2. **Three.js Forms cutscene** (5 seconds, no skip): Archetype card cracks. New form symbol burns in.
3. **Fata naming ritual prompt** fires if your Precision is Semi-Special or higher. This is the moment Fata shifts from companion to named entity.
4. **Moon Base Tier 2 unlocks:** Fata chamber opens. Full crafting stations become available.
5. **Supralunary view available** from Moon Base balcony — Pe-undefined space. Static beauty. No mechanics. The game's only non-scored location.

**L40 permanent unlocks:**
- Moon Base Tier 2 (Fata chamber + full crafting stations)
- War effort Siege Caller eligibility
- Supralunary Observatory (full view)
- Custodian broadcast eligibility (semi-Special grade required)

## L40 + Special Grade

Level 40 alone gives you the city. Special Grade gives you the deep mechanics inside it.

| State | What you have |
|-------|--------------|
| L40 only | Full content access, all locations, all crafting |
| Special Grade only | Deepest scoring mechanics, limited content access |
| L40 + Special Grade | True endgame — Custodian candidacy, war effort Bankai |

Neither axis is required to reach the other. They are parallel and the game is designed to be interesting at every combination.

## Pre-Corona: Calibration Framing

The first 3 scores are framed as a calibration run to remove the death valley before The Corona:

- **Score #1 of 3:** "Calibration Run. No Precision penalty for low accuracy. Just see where you land."
- **Score #2 of 3:** "Calibration Run. Your Pe estimates are forming. The anchor is coming into focus."
- **Score #3 of 3:** "Final calibration score. After this, real scoring begins."

After score #3: calibration ends, real scoring begins, The Corona is reachable. See [The Corona](../world/the-corona.md) for the threshold event.
