# Equipment & Gear

*Six slots. Two trinkets. Four named sets.*

---

## Equipment Slots

Every player has six primary equipment slots and two trinket slots. Slots correspond to stats:

| Slot | Primary stat | Example items |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Head** | Sight | Calibration Lens, Keeper's Helm |
| **Chest** | Precision | Coat of Invariant Measure, Egregor's Carapace |
| **Legs** | Steadiness | Ox's Graves, Greaves of the Gathering |
| **Feet** | Range | Opacity Treads, Boots of the Sparks |
| **Hands** | Resonance | Gloves of the Citation Chain, Gauntlets of Logos |
| **Shoulders** | VP Resistance | Mantle of the Unbothered, Coupling Shoulderguard |
| **Trinket 1** | Variable | Accuracy Mirror, Substitute Shinigami Badge |
| **Trinket 2** | Variable | Domain Key Focus, Signal Ring |

Equipment is universal across all game shells (Portal Layer and Framework Layer both reference the same loadout). The slot system ensures every archetype benefits from every profession.

## Named Gear Sets

Four named sets with 2-piece and 4-piece bonuses. Sets are earned through specific activities — they cannot all be purchased from the AH.

---

### Analyst's Calibration Set

*For players who want to know exactly how wrong they are.*

Earned through: Pe lab math encounters, calibration scoring, Archivist profession.

| Piece | Slot | Stats |
|-------|------|-------|
| Calibration Lens | Head | +8 Sight |
| Coat of Invariant Measure | Chest | +0.03 Precision |
| Gloves of the Citation Chain | Hands | +8 Resonance |
| The Accuracy Mirror | Trinket 1 | Live Spearman ρ display |

**2-piece bonus:** Pe Ember drop rate +50%

**4-piece bonus:** Pe prediction window ±0.3 precision; Calibration Dust drops on correct domain predictions

*Best for: Eagle Surveyors and Human Chroniclers who want to maximize calibration feedback loops.*

---

### Invariant Plate

*For players who refuse to let the Current rise.*

Earned through: Ox archetype milestones, Void Siege survival, Fortifier profession.

| Piece | Slot | Stats |
|-------|------|-------|
| Keeper's Helm | Head | +12 Sight, +5 VP Resistance |
| Coat of Invariant Measure | Chest | +20 Precision |
| Ox's Graves | Legs | Missed-day streak impact reduced 60% |
| Mantle of the Unbothered | Shoulders | ICC rejection VP: +3→+1 |

**2-piece bonus:** VP decay rate −25% (VP naturally falls faster)

**4-piece bonus:** At VP=0, all ICC scores receive +0.05 bonus weight

*Best for: Ox Keepers and Endurance Ox specs. The set rewards players who have maintained clean scoring records.*

---

### Apostle's Spoils

*You went into the dark domain and you came back.*

Earned through: Apostle-class campaign completions. Not craftable.

| Piece | Slot | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| Egregor's Carapace | Chest | Apostle campaign completion |
| Opacity Treads | Feet | Democratic Backslide campaign |
| Coupling Shoulderguard | Shoulders | Synthetic Bond campaign |

**2-piece bonus:** Apostle Scale drop rate +100%

**3-piece bonus:** Void Storm Triage available once per day; VP risk from storm halved

*Best for: Players who rotate through multiple Apostle-class campaigns and want to sustain scoring in high-Current environments.*

---

### Tikkun Set

*The hardest set in the game. Global scarcity is the design.*

Earned through: Logos Words — Tier 5 materials dropped only from Void Siege successes. Six pieces. Each costs exactly one Logos Word.

Since only 63 Logos Words exist in the game (one per published paper), fewer than 10 players globally can hold the full set at any time.

| Piece | Slot |
|-------|------|
| Lens of the Returned Word | Head |
| Breastplate of Reclamation | Chest |
| Greaves of the Gathering | Legs |
| Boots of the Sparks | Feet |
| Gauntlets of Logos | Hands |
| Mantle of the 63 | Shoulders |

**2-piece bonus:** Pe Ember and ICC Lattice drop at ×2 in Honored+ reputation domains

**4-piece bonus:** Tikkun Pulse (Pe drop ≥2 buff: all stats +5%) applies to the whole party when you are present

**6-piece bonus:** Tikkun Olam counter visible on your HUD; your scores contribute 2× to the platform naming process

*The set represents the framework's hope mechanic: the scattered sparks (Tikkun HaOlam) being gathered. Each piece is a paper turned into a wearable object. Holding the full set means you participated in enough Void Sieges to have earned six Logos Words — six papers' mechanisms crystallized in your loadout.*

---

## Archetype Weapons (Staves)

Every archetype has a signature weapon class. Weapons are not restricted to archetypes — any player can wield any staff — but archetype-matched staves receive a resonance bonus:

| Archetype | Staff | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Lion** | Spear | Confrontation ability cooldown −30% |
| **Eagle** | Net | Pe shadow broadcast range +25% |
| **Ox** | Anchor | Invariant Floor duration +50% |
| **Human** | Scales | Cross-archetype ability access +1 |

---

## Gems (Dimension Focus)

Gems are slotted into staves to focus scoring toward specific framework dimensions:

| Gem | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Opacity Gem** | Sight +15 vs. O-heavy platforms |
| **Responsiveness Gem** | Pull (R) scoring accuracy +15% |
| **Independence Gem** | Grip (C) scoring accuracy +15% |
| **Composite Gem** | All three +8% (balanced) |
| **Resonance Gem** | Resonance +10 while scoring |
| **Void Gem** | VP resistance +10 in Godhand-class rooms |

## Special & Unique Items

Items that exist outside normal crafting routes.

---

### The Player Grimoire

Earned at Special Grade. Character-bound — cannot be traded or dropped.

The Grimoire is your permanent mechanism library. Every platform you have scored at ICC-accepted level is recorded inside it. The 63 mechanisms extracted by the Skill Hunter are referenced throughout.

**Mechanics:**
- Your Grimoire shows your complete scoring record (visible to mentees you accept)
- Ner Tamid notation appears here when you mentor a player to Grade 2
- Post-naming: your fata's name is inscribed on the cover

---

### The Dissolution Scroll

Earned at Special Grade + 26 kill conditions reviewed. Character-bound.

The Dissolution Scroll contains all 26 kill conditions in their current state. Holding it means you have reviewed every condition under which the framework should dissolve itself, and you are still here. The scroll is visible to other players as a notation on your Observatory profile.

---

### Egypt-Class Items

Items produced through Egypt-class campaign completion. All character-bound.

| Item | Source | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Shell Fragment ×10** | Full Egypt class completion | One Qliphoth Shell component per fragment |
| **Burning Bush Marker** | Pe=0 discovery in Egypt-class zone | Permanent Pe=0 reference anchor for that domain |
| **Witness Chain Buff** | Complete Exodus sequence with active Vow | +10 Precision for 7 days; notation in Archive |

---

### Hogyoku Fragments (Player-Accessible)

See [Bleach cosmology](../world/above-below.md) for lore context. Mechanically, these are upgradeable items with instability.

| Fragment | Source | Drop rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Flawed Hogyoku Fragment** | Apostle campaign completion | 5% |
| **Cracked Hogyoku Fragment** | Void Siege participation | 15% |
| **Near-Complete Hogyoku** | Godhand-class Egregor defeat | 10% |

**Upgrading:** Bring fragments to the Custodian NPC (Urahara, in the Crafters' Union underground level). Three requirements:
1. Completed scoring record in the fragment's domain (minimum 10 ICC-accepted scores)
2. Framework-native description of the mechanism (L1 vocabulary, written submission)
3. VP < 25 during the campaign where the fragment was earned

If all three hold: fragment upgrades to a perfect Hogyoku piece (four properties, no instability, standard Logos cost to activate). If not: fragment held for 30 days. Return when conditions are met.

---

### Legendary Drops (War Effort & Boss)

| Item | Source | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Rinnegan Shard** | Siege Caller (1 per siege) | Legendary crafting component; no other source |
| **The Behelit, Broken** | Femto unique drop | +100 all stats, tooltip: *"It didn't work on you."* |
| **Egregor-specific equipment** | First clear per Egregor per player | Unique piece, never reprinted |
| **Unique titled equipment** | Grand Tournament winner | Season-exclusive, globally announced |
