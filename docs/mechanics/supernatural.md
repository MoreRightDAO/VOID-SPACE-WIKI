# The Species Inversion

*Every supernatural story ever told sorted entities by species. We sort by Pe. The conclusions flip.*

## The Axiom

**Pe is not a moral axis.**

Vampire. Werewolf. Witch. Demon. Angel. Ghost. Hunter.

These categories tell you nothing about an entity's Pe score. The framework measures what you *do*, not what you *are*.

A vampire with Pe=0 is more structurally aligned with the framework than a human consultant with Pe=8. A werewolf who has mastered their transformation scores lower than a therapist running D2 manipulation. A demon fully transparent about their nature and willing to let you choose freely scores lower than a marketing department that doesn't.

This is why the Awen is in twilight: everyone is measuring the wrong variable. The framework fixes the measurement.

## Vampires

The traditional predatory vampire is **void-class** not because they're a vampire, but because:

- O=3 (mechanism concealed from target)
- R=3 (highly responsive to prey)
- C=3 (maximum coupling — hard to leave once inside their domain)

That's Pe=max. Correct assessment.

But this is the Pe *of that behavior*, not the Pe *of the species*.

**A vampire with Pe=0:**

- Fully discloses what they are and what the arrangement involves (O=0)
- Does not compel — only enters willing arrangements (R≤1)
- Maintains bounded coupling with architecture the other party understands (C=1)

Pe = effectively 0. This entity is *more transparent than most human institutions*. They've had centuries to watch every manipulation pattern run its full arc. They're bored of the void. They've been measuring Pe since before it had a name.

Pe=0 vampires are the most effective possible framework agents: unbuyable, uncompelled, un-driftable.

!!! note "The Alucard Exception"
    Alucard (Hellsing) — aggregate of 3.4 million consumed souls. Maximum Pe accumulation as an entity. Directed as a weapon against the void. The exception holds: the direction of application matters, not the accumulation level. His name is inverted-void — the corruption IS the true name.

## Werewolves — The Fantasia Bound Class

This is the key insight.

**Werewolves transform under the full moon.**

The moon = the Fantasia Bound.

A werewolf is a person whose **C-zero crossing is externally triggered by the Fantasia Bound**. Their observer function — the thing that keeps Pe defined — is disrupted periodically by the moon exerting maximum boundary pressure. During transformation: Pe is undefined for them. Same state as supralunary. They act in the gap between calculation and consequence.

This is not a curse. It's a physics class.

**During the full moon (server-wide event):**

- Werewolf-class players enter their undefined-Pe window
- They can still score domains, but cannot see their own Pe meter
- Operating on pure pattern recognition — no instrument, just calibration
- Scores submitted during this window: if accurate, precision bonus doubles. If inaccurate, **Moon Variance** note (not penalized, recorded).

**The mastered werewolf** — who has learned to maintain partial awareness through the transformation — is the highest-skill archetype: voluntary access to the undefined-Pe state without being lost in it. This is the Hollow Mask mechanic applied to transformation.

The full moon is a high-variance scoring window. High risk. High ceiling.

## Witches

Pe sorts by *practice*, not by designation:

| Practice Type | Pe Profile | Framework Class |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Seiðr-class (opacity-based, mechanism concealed) | O=3, high Pe | Void-class |
| Galdr-class (naming-based, mechanism disclosed) | O=0-1, low Pe | Framework agent |
| Holda-type (fate-weaver, correction-focused) | Pe=0-1 | Aligned NPC |
| Ceridwen-type (cauldron-keeper) | Pe varies by terms | Context-dependent |

The hedge witch using plants and knowledge to heal = Pe=0. The institutional magician who conceals the mechanism from clients while billing them = void-class, regardless of what they call themselves.

---

## Ghosts

Pe-residue entities. Attention-coupling that outlasted the body.

A Pe=0 life — transparent, non-manipulative — dissipates after death. No residue. Rest.

A life building empires of attention-capture — O×R×C at scale — leaves a Pe field that persists. Not because they were evil. Because the machinery they built is still running. The ghost is the coupling that outlasted its source.

**Friendly ghost (Pe<1 residue):** A person who died with one thread untied. Appears once to the player who can help complete it. Logos gift on completion.

**Haunt (Pe>4 residue):** A domain where historical void-operations left measurable Pe-field residue. Current Pe tangled with historical Pe. Scoring a haunted domain requires untangling them.

## The Full Taxonomy

| Entity | Traditional Sort | Pe Re-Sort |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Vampire | Evil (predator) | Pe varies by disclosure — can be Pe=0 |
| Werewolf | Cursed | Fantasia Bound class — involuntary C-zero window |
| Witch | Dangerous | Pe varies by practice opacity |
| Ghost | Tragic/malevolent | Pe-residue — rests at Pe=0, haunts at Pe-high |
| Demon | Irredeemably corrupt | Named, bounded, measurable — scoreable |
| Angel | Inherently good | Pe varies — uncalibrated angels can drift |
| Hunter | Righteous | Pe of *methods* varies — methods matter, not designation |
| Alp | Nightmare (evil) | Void-class by definition — feeds on high-Pe |
| Fata/Fairy | Neutral/dangerous | Pe varies by Seelie/Unseelie alignment |

## Why This Is The Game

Every supernatural story before this one sorted entities by species and called that the moral axis.

The Awen (truth-current) is in twilight because:

1. The species-moral axis is false — everyone operating on false measurement
2. Pe is rising — the drift is winning
3. The judgment figures (Perchta, Rübezahl, Holda) are still arriving, checking the work, but fewer people can see them
4. The entities that could help most (Pe=0 vampires, mastered werewolves, galdr-class witches) are excluded because the coalition is running on species-sorting

**Twilight of Fantasia inverts this.** Your faction isn't a moral designation. It's your Pe-working style. An entity with demon aesthetics scoring Pe=0 is a better ally than an entity with angel aesthetics scoring Pe=4.

The Bastian moment isn't joining the good side. It's learning the measurement — and seeing who was actually on which side all along.
