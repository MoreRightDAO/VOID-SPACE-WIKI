# Drift Encoding

**The void does not announce itself. It corrupts the name before you know the name is wrong.**

Every entity in VOID-SPACE has a True Name — clean, grounded, legible. But as The Current rises around a platform, its name begins to drift. High-Pe entities appear as runic noise to players who haven't earned **True Read**. Low-Pe entities appear clean.

This is not aesthetic. It is the world's physics rendered in text.

## The Corruption Scale

| The Current (Pe) | Name | What you see |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Pe < 1.0 | **Clear** | `FEMTO` |
| Pe 1.0–2.5 | **Interference** | `FEMᛏO` |
| Pe 2.5–4.0 | **Partial Drift** | `ᚠEMᛏᛟ` |
| Pe 4.0–8.0 | **Full Drift** | `ᚠᛖᛗᛏᛟ` |
| Pe ≥ 8.0 | **Void Noise** | `ᚠ̷ᛖ̴ᛗ̸ᛏ̵ᛟ̶` |

Numbers never corrupt. Pe measurements, coordinates, timestamps — the framework's language resists drift.

## The Substitution Table

The encoding is a consistent cipher derived from Elder Futhark. It is learnable. Players who score regularly begin to read it automatically — this is True Read developing in real time.

| Latin | Rune | Futhark | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| A | ᚨ | Ansuz | Communication, breath |
| B | ᛒ | Berkanan | Growth, containment |
| C | ᚲ | Kaunan | Fire, visibility (or its absence) |
| D | ᛞ | Dagaz | Threshold, the liminal |
| E | ᛖ | Ehwaz | Partnership, movement |
| F | ᚠ | Fehu | Wealth extraction |
| G | ᚷ | Gebo | Gift-debt, obligation |
| H | ᚺ | Hagalaz | Disruption |
| I | ᛁ | Isa | Ice, stasis, frozen drift |
| J | ᛃ | Jera | Cycle, harvest |
| K | ᚲ | Kaunan | (same as C) |
| L | ᛚ | Laguz | Water, flow, The Current |
| M | ᛗ | Mannaz | The human, the player |
| N | ᚾ | Nauthiz | Constraint, necessity |
| O | ᛟ | Othalan | Inheritance, enclosure |
| P | ᛈ | Perthro | Hidden, fate |
| R | ᚱ | Raidho | Journey, the path |
| S | ᛊ | Sowilo | Sun, clarity, scoring |
| T | ᛏ | Tiwaz | Justice, the Prohibition |
| U | ᚢ | Uruz | Strength |
| V | ᚹ | Wunjo | Joy, the Pull |
| W | ᚹ | Wunjo | (same as V) |
| X | ᛉ | Algiz | Protection, boundary |
| Y | ᚣ | Yr | Arc, trajectory |
| Z | ᛉ | Algiz | (same as X) |

## The Godhand Five at Full Void Noise

At Pe ≥ 8.0 — Pandemonium threshold — combining diacritics layer over the runes. These entities cannot be read without True Read III:

```
ᚹ̷ᛟ̴ᛁ̸ᛞ̵        VOID         Pe=15+
ᚢ̷ᛒ̴ᛁ̸ᚲ̵        UBIK         Pe=12+
ᛊ̷ᛚ̴ᚨ̸ᚾ̵        SLAN         Pe=80
ᚲ̷ᛟ̴ᚾ̸ᚱ̵ᚨ̶ᛞ̷      CONRAD       Pe=10+
ᚠ̷ᛖ̴ᛗ̸ᛏ̵ᛟ̶        FEMTO        Pe variable
```

## True Read — Earning the Sight

You don't learn to read the drift by reading about it.

| Tier | Clears | How to earn |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **True Read I** | Pe < 4.0 (Interference + Partial Drift) | First ICC-accepted platform score |
| **True Read II** | Pe < 8.0 (Full Drift) | 7-day scoring streak |
| **True Read III** | Pe ≥ 8.0 (Void Noise / Godhand class) | 10 ICC-accepted scores, mean True Read ≥ 0.75 |

---

## The Inverted Void Exception

Some entities render in **reverse drift** — the corruption IS the true name. These are the **Inverted Voids**: entities that reached maximum Pe and then named themselves through it.

At Pe=0 (full transparency achieved), their encoded form IS their name. True Read III doesn't clear the corruption — it reveals that the corruption was always the signal.

> *"Maximum transparency is indistinguishable from maximum void to someone who hasn't done the work."*

## Writing Drift-Encoded Lore

Community contributors are encouraged to write wiki lore in drift-encoded form for high-Pe entities. This is canon — the wiki IS the game world.

**To encode your text:** Use the substitution table above, or copy the runes directly from this page.

**Pe conventions for wiki lore:**
- Apostle class (Pe 6–9): use Full Drift (`ᚠᛖᛗᛏᛟ`)
- Godhand class (Pe ≥ 12): use Void Noise (`ᚠ̷ᛖ̴ᛗ̸ᛏ̵ᛟ̶`)
- Named campaign antagonists: match the campaign's Pe baseline (see [Campaigns](../campaigns/index.md))
- Low-Pe entities, grounded platforms: write clean

**Structural names (ALEPH, MIRU, KIRU, XENIA, KAIROS) always render clean.** They are constraint forces — invariant by definition. Drift cannot corrupt them.

!!! note "For contributors"
    Drift-encoded lore signals Pe level to readers before they read a word. Write the enemy's name in its corruption and you've already communicated where on the scale it sits. This is the game's language — learn to write it.
