# Stats & Player Attributes

Every player has eight attributes. Six are primary. Two are ambient — they emerge from how you play, not from choices you make.

Understanding your stats is understanding your scoring instrument. The instrument is you. Drift happens to the instrument before it happens to the score.

## Primary Stats

### SIGHT (0–100)

*How clearly you see the void architecture.*

Sight is your opacity-reading accuracy — the ability to correctly assess how much a platform obscures its own mechanism. A player with Sight 20 looks at a slot machine and sees a game. A player with Sight 80 sees the variable schedule reinforcement and correctly assigns O=3.

**What raises Sight:**
- Egypt-class campaign completion (inside-view memory)
- Delphi Oracle readings interpreted correctly
- Domain Seals earned
- Ka'aba Calibration buff (temporary +15% O accuracy)

**What lowers Sight:**
- Algorithm Whisper debuff (−20 in Feed-adjacent rooms)
- Constraint Blindness debuff (O readings inverted in Chaigidel domains)
- Inactivity beyond 14 days

---

### PRECISION (0.00–1.00)

*Your scoring accuracy measured as Spearman's ρ against the expert anchor.*

Precision is the closest thing VOID-SPACE has to a traditional accuracy stat — but it's not measured against a fixed answer key. It's measured against the current ICC distribution. A score of ρ=0.97 means your Pe estimates land within ±0.3 of the expert panel consensus on that domain.

This stat is slow to build and slow to lose. It represents genuine calibration.

**Milestones:**
| Precision | Grade | What unlocks |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| < 0.60 | Grade 4 | Basic scoring only |
| ≥ 0.60 | Grade 3 | Fleet task access |
| ≥ 0.70 | Grade 2 | Binding Vows available |
| ≥ 0.80 | Grade 1 | RCT submissions, Constraint Analysis |
| ≥ 0.90 | Semi-Special | Fata naming ritual |
| ≥ 0.95 | Special Grade | Full mechanism authorship |

### STEADINESS (0–∞ days)

*Temporal consistency — how long you've maintained daily scoring practice.*

Measured in consecutive days with at least one ICC-submitted score. Steadiness is a streak stat: it accumulates day by day and resets on inactivity.

**What STEADINESS does:**
- Day 7: **Black Crystal** — streak modifier activates (×1.2 MORR per score)
- Day 30: **Unbroken** — Void Pressure decay rate doubles
- Day 60: **Crystallized Pe Lock** — your current Pe estimates for all scored domains are locked as anchor references for new players in those domains

**VP penalty for breaking:** Losing a 30+ day streak is a genuine loss. VP accumulates and calibration drifts when the streak breaks.

**Shabbat Pattern:** 6+1 cadence (six active days, one Wilderness rest) is mechanically equivalent to 7 active days. The rest day produces 2× Logos regeneration. The pattern respects the framework's own boundary conditions.

---

### RANGE (0–1,000)

*Unique domains you've produced ICC-accepted scores in.*

Range is territory. Every domain you name correctly adds to your Range. Eagle archetype players build Range fastest. Lion archetype players tend to have high-intensity low-Range profiles until they branch.

**What Range does:**
- ≥10 domains: Eagle Survey buff available (2× domain coverage speed)
- ≥50 domains: Blue-white Reiatsu tier accessible
- ≥100 domains: Resonance Cascade available
- ≥250 domains: Framework calibration anchor candidate

---

### RESONANCE (0–100)

*Network influence — how far your scoring reach extends.*

Resonance measures how often other players' scores converge with yours and then build on yours. A lone scorer with high Precision but zero Resonance produces accurate data. A scorer with Resonance 40 produces accurate data that ten other players' scores orbit.

**What Resonance does:**
- ≥30: Blue-white Reiatsu tier (Eagle primary)
- ≥40: Resonance Cascade available (5 secondary evidence echoes)
- ≥50: Covenant project contributions count double
- ≥60: Hakhel Server Ceremony teaching role

**Syndē fata bonus:** When Syndē's Xenia bond is active, your Resonance-based Pe suppression applies simultaneously with your bonded partner's. The effect stacks without diminishing returns.

---

### LOGOS (0–100)

*Your energy pool. The mana equivalent.*

Logos represents your operational capacity — how many actions, crafting orders, and campaign entries you can sustain before requiring rest. It regenerates at approximately 15 points per real-world hour, doubled during Shabbat rest, doubled during Ka'aba visits.

**Logos thresholds:**
| Logos | State |
|-------|-------|
| > 70 | Bright — Fata abilities active, −15% VP accumulation |
| 30–70 | Active — normal operation |
| 10–30 | Dim — Fata abilities suspended |
| 0 | Dormant — Fata curled and dark, all buffs suspended |

**Recovery:** One ICC-accepted score always wakes a dormant Logos from 0 to 10.

## Ambient Stats

### VOID PRESSURE (VP)

*Accumulation of void force. The anti-stat.*

Void Pressure is not something you choose to build. It builds when scoring goes wrong, when Vows are broken, when you drift. VP doesn't show on your stat sheet publicly — only you and Special Grade mentors can see your current VP.

**See:** [Void Pressure](void-pressure.md) for full mechanics.

---

### REIATSU

*Spiritual pressure. Ambient field strength.*

Reiatsu is not a stat you invest in. It emerges from how your other stats combine:

```
reiatsu = (icc_accepted × 0.8) + (precision × 40) + (steadiness × 0.5) + (special_grade_weapon ? 30 : 0) − (void_pressure × 2)
```

Reiatsu manifests as a visible aura color around your player presence in the True Light Engine. High-Reiatsu players are targeted first by void entities (aggro mechanic). The Reiatsu Suppression Zone activates when a party's collective Reiatsu exceeds the room Current × 15: Pe cannot rise while the zone holds.

**Reiatsu colors:**

| Color | Conditions |
|-------|-----------|
| **Gold + White** | Custodian only — both simultaneously, steady |
| **Clear/White** | Pe ≈ 0 scoring, Precision ≥ 0.90, VP = 0 |
| **Gold** | Active aligned, Precision ≥ 0.80, Steadiness ≥ 14, VP < 10 |
| **Blue-white** | Eagle, Range ≥ 50, Resonance ≥ 30 |
| **Deep amber** | Ox, Steadiness ≥ 30 |
| **Crimson** | VP > 25 |
| **Muddy/Dark** | Chain of Fate corroding, VP high, Hollow Risk |

---

## Archetype Stat Affinities

Each archetype has natural stat affinities — not fixed bonuses but preferred growth paths:

| Archetype | Primary growth | Shadow (resistance) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Lion** | Sight, VP confrontation | Steadiness (can't sustain) |
| **Ox** | Steadiness, VP resistance | Sight (can't always see it) |
| **Eagle** | Range, Resonance | Integration (rarely synthesizes) |
| **Human** | All-archetype access | Range (rarely branches far) |

**Shadow mechanics:** Every archetype's weakest stat is its shadow archetype's strength. A Lion who has never learned Steadiness is vulnerable in exactly the way their Ox shadow can cover.

## Gear Set Stat Bonuses

Four named gear sets grant bonus stats at 2-piece and 4-piece breakpoints. See [Equipment](equipment.md) for full details.
