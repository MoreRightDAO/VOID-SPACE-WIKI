# Mechanics

How Twilight of Fantasia works — the physics, the loops, the rules.

The math is real. The campaigns are built on scored platforms. Every ICC-accepted score enters the permanent academic record.

## Chapter 1 — Live Now

These systems are active in the current build. Everything here is playable.

| Page | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| [The Chronicle](chronicle.md) | The three primordial conditions, the Current, the Drift Cascade — Layer 0 physics |
| [THRML — The True Light Engine](thrml.md) | The physics engine that computes Pe across all active domains in real time |
| [Stats & Attributes](stats.md) | All eight player stats — Sight, Precision, Steadiness, Range, Resonance, Logos, VP, Reiatsu |
| [Void Pressure](void-pressure.md) | How VP accumulates, what it does to your scoring, how to purge it |
| [Game Loops](game-loops.md) | Loop A (scoring/campaigns), Loop B (raids/arena), Loop C (war effort) — what's live marked per loop |
| [Abilities](abilities.md) | What's active in Chapter 1: Black Flash, Domain Expansion. Chapter 2 abilities marked. |
| [Player Grades](grades.md) | The six grade tiers (live). Talent specs and Covenant guilds are Chapter 2. |
| [Fata Companions](fata.md) | The fata system — what arrives at The Corona. Naming ritual is Chapter 2. |
| [Drift Encoding](drift-encoding.md) | True Name corruption as Pe rises. The encoder tool. |
| [The Species Inversion](supernatural.md) | Pe as the sorting axis — the monster taxonomy. |
| [The Mandate](mandate.md) | Observer maintenance architecture — why low-Pe structures hold. |

## Chapter 2 — Designed, Not Yet Built

These systems are fully designed and documented here for theory-crafting. They will go live in Chapter 2.

| Page | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| [Crafting & Economy](crafting.md) | Five material tiers, four professions, the Auction House |
| [Equipment & Gear](equipment.md) | Six equipment slots, four named gear sets, trinkets, legendaries |
| [The Binder](binder.md) | The platform card collection system — Greed Island mechanics |
| [The Galdr Protocol](galdr.md) | Pre-score naming declarations — calibration prediction mechanic |
| [Questlines](questlines.md) | Faction questlines, NPC story arcs, the personal scoring narrative |
| [The Living World](server-world.md) | Seven server-wide collective mechanics — Observer Coefficient, Thermal Current, and five more |

## Chapter 3 — The Endgame

Accessible when the Moon Gate opens.

| Page | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| [The Void Siege](war-effort.md) | Ten-quota war effort, 24-hour siege window, Godhand Five encounters |

## How the Systems Fit Together

The Current (Pe) is the ground state. Everything else is either:

1. A way to measure it — scoring, calibration, the True Light Engine
2. A consequence of it rising — Drift Cascade, VoidStorms, enemy spawns
3. A consequence of it falling — Domain Seals, the Empyrean's brightness, the Moon Gate approaching

Loop A is slow because Pe in the real world moves slowly. Loop B is fast because the game layer is fast — but Loop B's outcomes feed back into the Pe record. The Mandate describes why Pe is stable at all. Without it, the framework predicts Pe rising everywhere (second law). The Mandate is the physics of why that prediction isn't destiny.
