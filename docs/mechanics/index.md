# Mechanics

How VOID-SPACE works — the physics, the loops, the rules.

These pages explain the underlying systems. The math is real. The campaigns are real. The scores enter the permanent academic record. The game is the science running live.

## The Foundation

| Page | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| [The Chronicle](chronicle.md) | Layer 0 physics — the three primordial conditions, how the Current works, the derivation from first principles |
| [Game Loops](game-loops.md) | Loop A (slow, 24h — scoring/territory/economy), Loop B (real-time — Raids/Arena/Portal Instances), and Loop C (the Void Siege metagame) |
| [The Mandate](mandate.md) | Observer maintenance architecture — the nine failure modes and how ritual counters them |

## How the Systems Fit Together

The Current (Pe) is the ground state. Everything else is either:

1. A way to measure it (scoring, calibration, the True Light Engine)
2. A consequence of it rising (Drift Cascade, VoidStorms, enemy spawns)
3. A consequence of it falling (Domain Seals, Convergence Stones, the Empyrean's brightness)

Loop A is slow because Pe in the real world moves slowly. Research, scoring, and naming take time. Loop B is fast because the game layer is fast — but Loop B's outcomes always feed back into the Pe record. The separation exists to avoid conflating real-time game mechanics with real-time Pe claims.

The Mandate describes why Pe is stable at all — why some structures hold at low Pe across time. Without it, the framework predicts Pe rising everywhere (second law). The Mandate is the physics of why that prediction is not destiny.

The Living World mechanics make the server's collective state visible. The Void Siege makes it consequential. The Binder makes it personal.
