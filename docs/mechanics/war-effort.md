# The Void Siege

*Ten quotas. One gate. No second chances.*

!!! danger "Chapter 3 — The Endgame"
    The Void Siege activates when the Moon Gate opens — when ten domain quotas are filled simultaneously. This is the Chapter 3 event that all of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 is building toward. Nothing here is live yet. Read it to know what you're working toward.

The Void Siege is the most significant event in Twilight of Fantasia. It is Loop C made concrete — the moment the server's accumulated scoring work becomes a siege weapon, and the Qliphoth domain becomes accessible.

A Siege is declared when a campaign's Current has remained at Pe ≥ 12 for a sustained period. The community has 2–4 weeks to gather the required materials. Then a 24-hour window opens. What happens in those 24 hours changes the world permanently.

---

## Declaration Conditions

A Void Siege can only be declared for **Godhand Five entities** — the five highest-class Egregor domains. Before a Siege can be declared:

1. The domain must sustain Pe ≥ 12 for 7 consecutive days
2. The corresponding Void Framework paper must be published (Zenodo DOI live)
3. At least 10 ICC-accepted scores from different players must exist in the domain

When conditions are met, the Custodian NPC (via GM tools) issues the Siege Declaration. The Observatory broadcasts the declaration globally.

## The Ten War Effort Quotas

Ten material categories must be filled simultaneously. The bottleneck design is intentional — Convergence Stones and Apostle Scales require coordinated multi-player scoring to produce.

| Front | Material | Quantity |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Opacity Front** | Pe Ember | ×500 |
| **Opacity Front** | Calibration Dust | ×2,000 |
| **Reactivity Front** | Constraint Crystal | ×1,500 |
| **Reactivity Front** | Invariant Fiber | ×800 |
| **Coupling Front** | Coupling Thread | ×5,000 |
| **Coupling Front** | Apostle Scale | ×300 |
| **Intelligence Front** | ICC Lattice | ×400 |
| **Intelligence Front** | Domain Key | ×50 distinct domains |
| **Resonance Front** | Echo Shard | ×10,000 |
| **Resonance Front** | Convergence Stone | ×25 |

**Economic shock:** War effort quotas trigger an AH price spike. Expect 4–6× price increases on all quota materials during the 2–4 week contribution window.

| Material | Pre-siege price | Siege price |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Pe Ember | ~25 MORR | 80–120 MORR |
| Convergence Stone | ~200 MORR | 500–800 MORR |
| Apostle Scale | ~50 MORR | 150 MORR |
| Coupling Thread | ~2 MORR | 8–12 MORR |
| ICC Lattice | ~40 MORR | 100 MORR |

## The Siege Caller

The player who donates the **final material** completing the last quota is designated **Siege Caller**. Permanent title. Displayed on the leaderboard forever. First pick of boss loot on opening night. One Rinnegan Shard.

The Siege Caller title cannot be purchased. It can only be earned by timing the final contribution correctly.

---

## The 24-Hour Siege Window

After all ten quotas are filled, a 1-hour preparation window begins. Then the siege opens.

**Siege conditions:**
- Pe spikes immediately (+3 above pre-siege baseline)
- Void Storm activates continuously for the duration
- Full debuff stack applies to all players inside: Fate, Destiny, Inevitability, Constraint Blindness
- Multiple raid groups can enter sequentially — damage accumulates across all groups

The entity does not have a failure state in the sense of "party wipes and nothing happens." The Siege window closes after 24 hours regardless. Damage dealt and scoring accuracy during the window determine the outcome.

## Outcomes

### Success

The entity's Current drops to 0. The world changes permanently:

- Domain Current reduces by 1 point, permanently
- Observatory entity node darkens, then pulses white
- Tikkun Olam counter ticks
- Domain marked **NAMED** — permanent
- Kill record written on-chain (immutable)

**Loot (final raid group):**
- Qliphoth Shell ×5 (split among participants)
- Logos Word ×2 (to highest ICC scorers)
- Schala's Needle (if ≥3% of siege participants held active C2PA Vow)
- Egregor-specific equipment (first clear, never reprinted)

**Voice lines from the Hand of Fantasia at success:**
> ALEPH: *"Named."*
> MIRU: *"Witnessed."*
> KIRU: *"Constrained."*
> XENIA: *"Released."*
> KAIROS: *"Free."*

### Failure

The siege window closes with the entity undefeated:

- Current rises +3 for 30 days (domain is harder to score in)
- All war effort materials consumed (no refund)
- Entity gains a new ability (GM adds post-failure — this is announced)
- "The Drift" debuff applied to all participants: −10% all stats for 7 days
- Observatory records: **RESISTED** tag on the domain entry

Failure is recoverable. Another Siege can be declared when conditions are met again. The materials lost are gone, but the domain doesn't become permanently inaccessible.

## The Godhand Five Siege Order

The five Void Siege targets, in order. They can only be accessed in this sequence:

| Order | Entity | Domain | Unlock condition |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | VOID (Thaumiel) | Feed Algorithm | Base — always available when Pe ≥ 12 |
| 2 | UBIK (Chaigidel) | Advertising/Persuasion | Paper 17 published |
| 3 | CONRAD (Sathariel) | Democratic Backslide | Siege 1 completed |
| 4 | SLAN (Gamaliel) | Synthetic Bond | Siege 2 completed |
| 5 | FEMTO (Nehemoth) | [The Grief Campaign] | All four above cleared. Femto's existence not announced until The Idea of Evil is defeated. |

## The Tablet of Law

The invariant rules that govern the Siege and cannot be modified by any player action or Oracle Panel ruling:

1. **ICC is the validity criterion** — Oracle Panel applies the Tablet; it does not interpret it
2. **Expert anchor exists** — the scoring record has an academic foundation
3. **Kill conditions are permanent** — 26 conditions, predate all players
4. **Pe = (Veil × Pull) / Grip** — the formula is immutable
5. **Custodian self-score Pe = −77** — live, public, renewed annually
6. **CC-BY papers are irrevocable** — framework dissolution cannot erase the published record
7. **MoreRight License v1.1 is binding** — Tier 2 applied papers remain under constraint

These rules cannot be changed by the Culling Game Rule System. They are prior to the game.
