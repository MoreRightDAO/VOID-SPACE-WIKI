# The Binder

*Your personal platform library. The collection system.*

!!! abstract "Chapter 2"
    The Binder card system launches in Chapter 2. In Chapter 1, your scored platforms are tracked in your profile. The full card collection, trading, and Greed Island actions come in Chapter 2.

---

The Binder is your permanent record of everything you've scored and every mechanism you've named. It is a Greed Island-derived system: cards represent scored platforms, gathered mechanisms, and known techniques. Some cards are transferable. Some are character-bound. All of them are real — they represent genuine scoring work, not cosmetic tokens.

## Binder Card Types

### Specified Cards (26 slots)

The 26 kill conditions occupy the first 26 slots of every player's Binder. These slots are permanent and unchangeable.

The kill conditions predate any player. They were specified before the game existed. Your Binder reflects this: these slots were already filled when you arrived. A player who produces evidence that triggers a kill condition doesn't destroy their Binder — they close a chapter in the permanent record.

**Kill condition display:** Each Specified Card shows the condition text, its current status (0/26 triggered), and any related evidence submitted by the community.

### Free Slot Cards (40 slots)

Forty tradeable slots for scored platform cards. Each ICC-accepted score in a new domain produces a platform card in your Binder.

**Card rarity by platform class:**

| Platform class | Card type |
|---------------|----------|
| Drifter (Pe 3–6) | Common card |
| Apostle (Pe 6–9) | Inscribed card (domain-specific bonus) |
| Godhand (Pe ≥ 12) | Special Grade card (globally limited) |
| Pe = 0 platform | Legendary card (near-unique) |

---

### Unlimited Cards (3 slots)

Three permanent reference platforms — the calibration anchors that define the low end of the Pe scale:

1. **Scripture** — the canonical fixed text. Veil = 0 (mechanism fully disclosed), Pull = 0 (does not respond to engagement), Grip = 0 (voluntary participation bounded by ritual structure). Pe = 0.
2. **Gutenberg (early print)** — constrained information reproduction. Historical Pe record.
3. **The Tapes** — raw recorded testimony. No algorithm. No engagement optimization. Unmediated.

These three are always in your Binder. They cannot be removed. They exist to provide a permanent Pe=0 reference — what scoring looks like when the architecture has zero void conditions.

## Card Actions

The Greed Island card mechanics translated into Twilight of Fantasia scoring operations:

### CLONE
Replicate your scoring for peer review. Creates a second copy of your Binder card that can be submitted to the Oracle Panel for validation. Used when you believe your score is correct and want independent verification.

### ACCOMPANY
Co-scoring session. You and another player score the same platform simultaneously, with results sealed until both submit. Combined score carries elevated ICC weight. The Culling Game's most cooperative mechanic.

### LOTTERY
Random nomination from your target queue. Useful when you have many platforms queued and want the system to assign priority. The system draws from domains with the highest Thermal Current pressure.

### PALADIN'S NECKLACE
*Cost: 20 MORR*

Protect a score from dispute for 72 hours. During this window, the Oracle Panel cannot be petitioned to contest your score. Used when you've produced an accurate score in a politically contested domain and need time for convergence evidence to accumulate.

### SWORD OF TRUTH
Counter-score to revise a Pe estimate. If you believe a score in the permanent record is inaccurate, you can submit a Sword of Truth — a counter-score with supporting evidence. If the Oracle Panel validates your counter, the original score's ICC weight is reduced and your counter becomes the reference.

The Sword of Truth is one of the mechanisms that prevents the scoring record from calcifying around early inaccurate estimates.

## Binder Raiding (PvP)

In Culling Game Arena sessions, the winner takes one card from the loser's Binder — drawn randomly from the Free Slot cards. Character-bound cards (Specified and Unlimited) cannot be raided.

PvP ante: 10–500 MORR stake per session, plus card raiding rights.

This mechanic is intentionally high stakes: if you have a Godhand-class card from the first clear of an Apostle campaign, and you enter the Culling Game against a stronger player, you risk losing it. The design aligns with the framework's logic: the Binder's value comes from genuine scoring work, and the highest-value cards represent the most dangerous territory.

## The Geto Problem

The Binder can be used the wrong way.

A player who scores platforms to accumulate mechanisms — not to constrain them, but to possess them and use them — is building a Geto-type Binder. The cards are real. The scoring was accurate. But the purpose has inverted: instead of naming the mechanism to name it (releasing it from opacity), the scorer is naming it to absorb it.

Signs of a Geto-type Binder:
- Apostle and Godhand cards accumulated but no corresponding ICC weight reduction in those domains
- VP rising alongside Binder size
- Scores accurate but producing no Pe reduction in the domains scored

The Oracle Panel does not automatically flag Geto-type Binderists. Other players scoring the same domains provides the correction — independent scoring pressure eventually overwhelms any single player's accumulated card advantage.

---

## The Bookshop (Credentialed Access)

God Hand activation (Simple Domain — C-zero crossing) = the Nen awakening equivalent. The moment of activation is the moment the player's Binder becomes live.

Before activation: observatory access, browsing, watching. No submissions. No card accumulation.

After activation: the session token is active. 25 free MCP credits on first connection. The Binder is open.

The Bookshop is the underlying system: a credentialed access layer that tracks which players have activated, what their scoring record looks like, and whether their grade qualifies them for the mechanic tier they're attempting to use.
