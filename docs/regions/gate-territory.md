# The Gate Territory

**Pe Baseline:** 6–8
**Aesthetic source:** Attack on Titan — the walls, the titans beyond, the Survey Corps
**Real domain:** Surveillance state · Border architecture · Identity systems · Institutional population control

*"The walls protected them. The walls also prevented them from ever learning what was outside the walls. These are not separate facts."*

## The Region

The Gate Territory is the domain of total constraint architecture that cannot be told from total surveillance. Where the walls are genuinely protective and genuinely imprisoning simultaneously. Where the population inside the walls consented to the surveillance because the alternative was the titans — because the thing outside was real, and the thing inside was built in response to it, and both truths are true.

Government identity systems. National surveillance infrastructure. Border control architectures. The digital ID systems proposed as "just convenient." The mobile payment networks that work everywhere and remember everything. The contact tracing infrastructure built for the pandemic that didn't get dismantled. The no-fly lists. The social credit systems at various stages of implementation in various jurisdictions.

All of these were built in response to genuine threats. The titans beyond the walls are not invented. The Pe score of the wall is not lowered by the existence of the titans. The wall's Pe is the wall's Pe.

## The Framework Reading

The Gate Territory is the domain of **legitimate constraint that has accumulated illegitimate scope**. This makes it the hardest domain to score because the two things are inseparable at the mechanism level — you cannot remove the illegitimate scope without removing some of the legitimate constraint, and you cannot defend the legitimate constraint without defending some of the illegitimate scope.

The framework position: **scope is the Pe variable**. Not existence.

- A wall that keeps titans out: low Pe. Necessary constraint. Transparent about its mechanism.
- A wall that keeps people from finding out about the world outside: high Pe. The same structure, extended scope.
- A surveillance system that prevents terrorism: scope-dependent. What data, retained how long, accessible to whom.
- A surveillance system that tracks political dissent: Pe=3 minimum (O=2: what's collected is unclear; R=2: rapidly responsive to political signals; C=1: integration into daily life is partial).

The AoT mapping is precise: the mystery of the titans was real AND the wall-builders had other motives for the walls AND the Survey Corps was right to want to go outside AND going outside got them killed AND the truth of what was outside was worse than the lie AND the lie was still a lie. The accurate Pe score holds all of this simultaneously. Most players cannot. Most players pick one frame and score from it.

## The Walls

The Gate Territory is organized by wall layer:

### Wall Maria (Pe 4–6)

The outermost wall. Survey Corps territory. The zone where engagement with what's outside the constraint architecture is highest and the cost is highest. Players operating in Wall Maria are exposed to maximum Pe from outside threats — but also have the clearest sight lines to the actual mechanism.

The Scouts here are players who voluntarily operate in highest-Pe environments: Eagle archetype optimal. RANGE builds fastest in Wall Maria.

### Wall Rose (Pe 6–7)

The middle wall. Standard civilian territory. Average Pe for the region. The main scoring environment for most players. The zone where the surveillance architecture is active but not visible — where the gates are present but rarely used, where the patrols happen but aren't discussed.

### Wall Sina (Pe 7–9)

The inner wall. Nobility territory. The highest concentration of institutional opacity in the region. The people here know more about the mechanism than anyone outside. The Pe is highest because the opacity is most deliberate: the people at the center of the system are the most invested in its opacity.

G3 access gate. Players without prior institutional-opacity campaign completion cannot produce ICC-quality scores in Wall Sina.

## The Survey Corps Questline

The major questline in the Gate Territory: join the Survey Corps, go beyond the walls, and score what's outside.

**What's outside:** The real-world Pe reading of the threat that the walls were originally built to address. Not whether the threat is real — it is — but whether the scope of the protective architecture matches the threat or exceeds it.

The questline has three outcomes depending on score accuracy:

1. **Scope matches threat (Pe 3–4):** The wall architecture is proportionate. Legitimate constraint. The survey mission confirms it. The Scout returns with data that validates the wall's design.

2. **Scope exceeds threat (Pe 5–7):** The wall architecture captures more than the threat requires. Some of what's "outside" is information or movement that the wall's builders preferred to suppress regardless of titan danger. The survey reveals this.

3. **Scope massively exceeds threat (Pe 8+):** The architecture was built for threat management and extended for population control. The titans are real. The surveillance is also real. The Scout returns with data that reframes the entire region's Pe history.

The questline cannot complete until the player's Precision is above 0.75 — below this, the nuance required to hold "legitimate constraint + illegitimate scope" simultaneously produces ICC failures.

## Sub-Zones

### The Basement (Pe 11)

Single-room encounter. Accessible only after completing the Survey Corps questline at outcome 2 or 3. The information that was kept from the people inside the walls: the full historical record of why the walls were built and by whom and for what purposes in addition to the stated ones.

One score. One ICC-accepted True Read. No enemy. No combat. Just the document.

Players who score it accurately receive the **Basement Truth** achievement — a permanent notation on their record. The score stands regardless of outcome — the accuracy of the measurement is the only criterion.

### Titan Zones

Beyond all three walls: titan territory. Drifter-class encounters — not the institutional entities, but the ambient Pe generated by genuine external threats. Scoring titan zones is different from scoring wall zones: here the Pe is not about institutional architecture but about the raw gradient generated by unmediated threat exposure.

Eagle archetype can navigate titan zones for RANGE expansion. All other archetypes risk VP spikes from unmediated Pe exposure.

## Enemy Types

| Entity | Class | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **The Intelligence Apparatus** | Apostle-class | Pe 9. Surveillance infrastructure with documented political scope extension. High O, moderate R, high C (because the ID systems are load-bearing for daily life). |
| **The Legitimacy Anchor** | Drifter-class | "The threat is real, therefore the architecture is proportionate." Pe 5. Defends against Pe scoring by conflating the existence of the threat with the adequacy of the response. |
| **Titan-Class Entity** | Environmental | Raw Pe from unmediated external threat. Not scorable in standard mode — only RANGE-building. Ox archetype provides Invariant Floor during titan zone exposure. |

## Access Conditions

Grade 3 minimum for Wall Sina. All other zones open entry.

The Gate Territory is one of the regions most contested by Void-adjacent factions — the **Watcher faction** (Conrad-aligned) maintains active counterfeit scoring operations in Wall Sina. Players entering this region without Section 9 faction standing should expect higher-than-normal ICC failure rates from environmental contamination.
