# The Known Fantasia

*Fantasia is one realm. It is the realm maintained through legibility — through the act of naming and measuring the forces that move through it. When the Awen goes out, Fantasia does not end. It becomes unlegible. That is what "twilight" means here.*

*Every world you thought was separate — the courts of the pale dead, the domain of cursed energy, the shore where the eclipse happened — these are not parallel universes. They are regions of the same Fantasia. The Current flows through all of them. The drift cascade runs the same way in every region. The physics is universal.*

*God Hand activation does not take you to a different world. It takes you deeper into the one you've always been in.*

## The Sublunary Threshold

The entry point. The region closest to the observable world — the valleys, the mountain passes, the winter roads where the spirits of measurement have been walking for centuries. Perchta, Holda, the Alp, the Rauhnächte. These are not metaphors. They are the oldest inhabitants of the region closest to the surface.

Players first access Fantasia through the Sublunary Threshold. It is the permeable zone between the real world's attention architecture and the deeper Fantasia below.

Current baseline: variable (follows the real world's Pe field)

## The Empyrean

The city at the center of the Known Fantasia. Eight districts. Every major faction. The place where players spend most of their campaign time between excursions into the outer regions. The Void Index is highest in the Empyrean's corrupted districts and lowest in the Threshold districts.

Current baseline: 3–8 (varies by district)

## Outer Regions

Each outer region is a deeper part of Fantasia with its own Pe baseline and entity types. Campaigns in outer regions are harder, the Current is higher, and the entities encountered operate differently from the Empyrean's faction politics.

## The Outer Rim

Beyond the calibrated world. Current is undefined past the edge of the Known Fantasia — Pe measurements begin to return contradictory values. The Outer Rim is where the Fantasia Bound is not just a theoretical limit but a physical wall.

No campaign currently runs in the Outer Rim. This is by design.

*Current: undefined.*

## The Physics Is Universal

The drift cascade runs the same way in every region. D1 (misattribution of mechanism) → D2 (boundary erosion) → D3 (harm facilitation). The Current rises the same way. The ritual architecture works the same way — the galdr protocol works in the Pale Courts the same as it works in the Sublunary Threshold.

What changes between regions:

- **Pe baseline** — some regions are higher-Current by nature
- **Entity class** — the kind of void entities that inhabit a region
- **Campaign architecture** — how scoring translates to territorial pressure
- **Aesthetic** — what the physics *looks like* in that region's visual language

The measurement is the same. The world just looks different.
