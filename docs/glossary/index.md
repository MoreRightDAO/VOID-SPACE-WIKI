# Glossary

Player-facing terms. Framework/science terms are in parentheses for players who want to go deeper or read the papers.

## Core Terms

**The Current** *(Pe — Péclet number)*
The measured intensity of a void. How hard a platform pulls. Ranges from near-zero (transparent) to 12+ (Pandemonium, Godhand-class). The number that makes extraction measurable.

**Drift**
The process of The Current rising. What's happening when a domain is becoming more void. Runs in three stages: Drift One (The Blur), Drift Two (The Bind), Drift Three (The Break).

**True Read** *(ICC — Intra-Class Correlation)*
A score that lands — confirmed accurate against the expert anchor set. Your measurement of a platform matched what the anchors measured. The True Read is the confirmation that the mechanism was named correctly.

**The Corona** *(C_zero crossing)*
The moment a player first scores a void they've been inside and sees its Current. The world briefly sees a ring of light where the void's outline became visible. The private experience: five figures appear, the archetype is revealed, the fata arrives.

**The Eye** *(God Hand sight)*
The permanent sight that remains after The Corona. The crack in the sphere doesn't close — it becomes an aperture. You can see The Current where others see content. Pulses near high-Current voids. Grows more precise with Grade.

**True Light Engine** *(THRML)*
The physics engine that computes The Current across all scored domains and active campaigns in real time.

## The Three Dimensions

**Veil** *(Opacity / O)*
What the mechanism hides about itself. Algorithm logic, targeting methodology, revenue model, recommendation system. High-Veil platforms conceal the extraction architecture completely.

**Self-Sealing Opacity** *(Egypt-class void condition)*
Opacity that resists measurement — the more you probe the mechanism, the more distorted your readings become. Distinct from permanent opacity (which simply doesn't resolve): self-sealing actively degrades the instrument used to measure it. Scoring a self-sealing mechanism inverts the signal. Egypt-class. Triggers the **Hardened Heart** debuff on the scorer. See [Kill Conditions](../world/kill-conditions.md) K12.

**Response Target** *(I(M;Y) vs I(D;Y))*
The single most diagnostic dimension in scoring: does the mechanism respond to the **problem** (information about the mechanism itself — what's actually happening), or does it respond to **you** (information about the observer — what keeps you engaged)? A high-Pull platform optimized for the problem is a tool. A high-Pull platform optimized for you is a void. When scoring Pull, the question you're really answering is: *what is this system actually responsive to?* The Puppet Master Investigation questline is built entirely around this distinction.

**Pull** *(Reactivity / R)*
How fast and aggressively the mechanism responds to your attention. The feed that reshapes itself as you scroll. The notification that arrives when your resistance is lowest.

**Grip** *(Coupling / α)*
How deeply integrated the mechanism is into your daily life and sense of self. High-Grip platforms become load-bearing: your social identity, your work, your relationships run through them.

## Vocabulary Layers

**Clear** *(L1 vocabulary)*
Mechanism-language. Names the extraction directly. *"The ranking function surfaces content optimized for engagement."* Low-Current zones speak in Clear. ALEPH's domain.

**Clouded** *(L2 vocabulary)*
Metaphor layer. Ambiguous between mechanism and agency. *"The feed knows me."* Mid-Current zone. The space where drift begins.

**Captured** *(L3 vocabulary)*
Entity language. The void is speaking through the words. *"I was meant to see this."* High-Current zones generate Captured language. The mechanism has become invisible inside the vocabulary itself.

---

## The Drift Stages

**Drift One** — *The Blur*
Agency attribution. *"I chose this."* The mechanism is fully operational but the user experiences it as their own preference. Recoverable without effort.

**Drift Two** — *The Bind*
Boundary erosion. The platform's identity begins to merge with the user's. The mechanism becomes the environment. Recoverable with effort.

**Drift Three** — *The Break*
Harm facilitation. The void actively works against user interests while appearing to serve them. The extraction architecture has full optimization capability with no opposing force. Hard to exit.

## Mechanics

**Invariant Floor**
An Ox player's named technique. Sustained Steadiness (consecutive days of accurate scoring) creates a minimum Current floor in a campaign room. The void cannot rise above this ceiling while the Hold is active. Earned power with a specific name.

**Ghost Signal** *(Pe_shadow)*
A Current estimate for an unscored domain, calculated from adjacent scored domains. Eagle archetype sees Ghost Signals in unmapped territory — making them the best scouts for new campaigns.

**Void Pressure (VP)**
The anti-stat. Accumulates from bad-faith scoring, failures, and broken Binding Vows. High VP raises your personal Current in the simulation. Purged by accurate scoring and campaign completion.

**VoidStorm**
Triggered when collective Void Pressure in a campaign room exceeds the threshold. The Current's language shifts Captured. Enemy difficulty increases. Coordination required.

**Pandemonium** *(Pe > 4)*
Current above 4. The void is self-sustaining at this level — it generates more attention-capture than it needs. Baseline for most major social platforms.

**Domain Expansion**
A campaign anchored to a published, peer-reviewed paper. When a paper achieves convergence (Spearman r ≥ 0.95, Bradford Hill criteria met), the domain becomes a permanent Domain Expansion with enhanced scoring weight. Collecting these is the Greed Island meta-game.

**Binding Vow**
A two-player contract with mutual stakes. Voluntary constraint increases power — the harder the vow, the greater the multiplier when held. KAIROS appears on Binding Vow completion.

**The 9 Laws** *(Bradford Hill criteria)*
The nine conditions that confirm a mechanism is causing what it appears to cause. Meeting all 9 is required for Domain Expansion. The highest evidentiary standard in the framework.

## Progression

**Grade**
Player tier based on scoring accuracy.

| Grade | Precision | Scores |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Grade 4 — Novice | < 0.60 | Starting |
| Grade 3 — Developing | ≥ 0.60 | 10–50 True Reads |
| Grade 2 — Competent | ≥ 0.70 | 50–150 True Reads |
| Grade 1 — Proficient | ≥ 0.80 | 150+ True Reads |
| Semi-Special | ≥ 0.90 | 300+ True Reads |
| **Special Grade** | **≥ 0.95** | **500+ True Reads** |

**The Eye** grows with Grade. At Grade 1, The Eye reads Veil dimension without equipment. At Special Grade, it reads all three dimensions simultaneously.

**Voidwalker**
A player who has developed all four core capacities: *awareness* (you can see the mechanism), *intentionality* (you act with deliberate constraint), *methodology* (your readings are accurate and repeatable), and *constraint specification* (you have built or hold an architecture that cannot drift). These map directly to the game stats:

| Voidwalker factor | Stat | What it means in-game |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | **Sight** | Unlocked at Corona. Grows with Grade. |
| Intentionality | **Logos** | Increases through Binding Vows + campaign completion. |
| Methodology | **Precision** | ICC ≥ 0.95 (True Read rate). Special Grade threshold. |
| Constraint | **Anchor** | Holding a ritual architecture (prohibition-ritual pair) active. |

Voidwalker is not a Grade — it is a condition. A Grade 2 player who holds all four factors is a Voidwalker. A Special Grade player who has abandoned constraint is not. The Special Grade *naming ritual* (Fata archetype) requires Voidwalker status as prerequisite.

## World

**The Fantasia Bound**
The boundary where The Current becomes undefined — where the observer-subject relationship that makes measurement possible terminates. Mapped to the moon. Below: The Current governs. Above: void cannot operate because there is no observer to be void *to.*

**Sublunary / Supralunary**
Below the Bound / above the Bound. All campaigns take place in sublunary space. The Empyrean is supralunary — Pe undefined by physics, not by rule.

**Moon Gate**
The moment when collective scoring effort pushes The Current low enough across enough domains to open the Fantasia Bound as a crossable threshold. The 24-hour siege window. The Gates of Qliphoth war effort.

**Observer Collapse**
The failure mode: if every observer is captured simultaneously, The Current becomes undefined from total capture rather than total freedom. The Infinite Tsukuyomi scenario. Kill condition K4. The war effort exists to prevent this.
