# Archetypes

Your archetype is not chosen. It is revealed.

During [God Hand activation](../world/the-corona.md), five behavioral signals collected across your early scoring sessions are cross-referenced against a five-question battery. The combination produces a reading — not a quiz result, but a recognition. Something about how you already engage with the framework matches a specific orientation.

The four base archetypes correspond to the four living creatures of ancient visionary tradition — the figures that ALEPH, MIRU, KIRU, and XENIA each embody:

## The Four

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[The Lion](lion.md)**

    Confronter. Forward-facing. Tracks high-Pe entities directly. Primary stat: SIGHT. Shadow: Ox.

    *Drawn to the highest-Current domains. Goes in first. When the Lion is in the room, Pe falls faster.*

-   **[The Ox](ox.md)**

    Sustainer. Holds the floor. The Invariant Floor technique is an Ox ability. Primary stat: STEADINESS. Shadow: Lion.

    *What the Lion confronts, the Ox constrains. When the Ox holds, the room cannot drift past the floor.*

-   **[The Eagle](eagle.md)**

    Scout. Navigator. Sees Ghost Signals in unscored territory. Reveals domains before anyone enters them. Primary stat: RANGE. Shadow: Human.

    *The Eagle knows what the room doesn't yet see. Pe shadows lit by Eagle Range are the map everyone else follows.*

-   **[The Human](human.md)**

    Integrator. Network node. Work builds on other work. The Human's validation retroactively tightens everyone's scores. Primary stat: RESONANCE. Shadow: Eagle.

    *The Human doesn't score alone — the Human makes everyone's scoring better. Resonance Cascade fires outward.*

## Archetype Is Not Class

You don't pick a role in a party comp. The archetype is a reading of your actual behavior in the framework. Players who score mostly new domains will read Eagle. Players who score consistently every day will read Ox. Players who go straight for high-Pe platforms will read Lion. Players who build on others' evidence read Human.

You can play in any role. Your archetype just tells you where your natural leverage is highest — and names your shadow (the inferior function, the dimension you're least developed in).

**Shadow visibility:**
- Grade 1: Shadow archetype named on profile
- Grade 2: Shadow stat and suppression displayed publicly
- Special Grade: Must complete one campaign in shadow archetype role — individuation mechanic

## The Fata

There is a fifth type. Not a player archetype — a companion class.

The Fata are not base-archetype players. They are LIMINAL beings — of the Fantasia Bound itself, not below it. The Custodian is a Fata of the CAOLÍN designation. Players do not become Fata through progression. Fata status is a different kind of being.

## Hand of Fantasia Correspondence

The four archetypes are reflected in the four figures:

| Archetype | Figure | Dimension |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Lion | [ALEPH](../figures/aleph.md) | Confrontation — the Will that meets the void face to face |
| Ox | [MIRU](../figures/miru.md) | Steadiness — the sustained presence that holds the floor |
| Eagle | [KIRU](../figures/kiru.md) | Range — the sight that maps unseen territory |
| Human | [XENIA](../figures/xenia.md) | Integration — the hospitality that builds networks of trust |

[KAIROS](../figures/kairos.md) speaks to all four and stays with none.
