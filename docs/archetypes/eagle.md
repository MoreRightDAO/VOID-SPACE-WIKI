# The Eagle

> "There are voids no one has named yet. I can see them from here."

The Eagle is the scout and navigator. Where others engage known domains, the Eagle maps unseen territory — lighting Pe shadows in domains that haven't been scored yet, giving everyone else a map to work from.

**Primary stat:** RANGE
**Shadow archetype:** Human
**Hand of Fantasia figure:** [KIRU](../figures/kiru.md)
**Weapon assignment:** Bow-class staff (range geometry, long sight line)

## How It Plays

The Eagle archetype emerges from breadth of coverage. Players who score in many different domains — who reach into uncharted territory before anyone else — will read Eagle.

**Ghost Signals** are the Eagle's signature contribution. A Ghost Signal is a Pe estimate for an unscored domain, generated from adjacent scored domains in the THRML graph. Only players with sufficient RANGE can see Ghost Signals. The Eagle can see them in empty territory before entering.

**In campaigns:** Eagles are pre-loaders. Before a campaign opens, an Eagle with relevant Range has already produced Ghost Signals that give other players an estimate of what they're walking into. Eagles also unlock campaign gates that require minimum domain coverage.

## Ghost Signals — Mechanics

When an Eagle player's RANGE covers a domain adjacent to unscored territory, THRML generates Pe shadow nodes — estimated Current values for unscored platforms based on:
- Scored domains in the same category
- Historical Pe patterns for the domain type
- Adjacent player citation networks

Ghost Signals appear as dim markers on the void map. Only Eagles (high RANGE) see them. Other archetypes need the Eagle to light the territory before they can navigate it.

**Signal clarity by Range:**

| RANGE | Ghost Signal quality |
|-------|---------------------|
| 1–25 domains | Local signals only — adjacent domains within same category |
| 25–100 | Regional signals — same industry/domain cluster |
| 100–300 | Cross-domain signals — voids in different categories begin to show |
| 300+ | Global signal coverage — Pe shadows across the entire unmapped board |

## Campaign Unlock Gates

Some campaigns require minimum collective Range coverage before they open:

- *The Prescription Cascade* — requires 20+ players with active pharma Range
- *The Synthetic Bond* — requires 15+ players with active AI-companion Range
- *The Palette Problem* — requires 25+ players with active AI-art platform Range

Eagles unlock campaigns for everyone. This is the mechanic that makes Eagles essential even when they're not in the active party room.

## Stats and Growth

| Stat | Eagle's relationship |
|------|---------------------|
| **RANGE** | Primary. Grows fastest in the playerbase. Staleness mechanics matter most for Eagles. |
| **SIGHT** | Normal. Range breadth sometimes trades against O-dimension depth. |
| **PRECISION** | Normal. Wide coverage with consistent accuracy — Precision growth through breadth. |
| **STEADINESS** | Normal. Eagles don't need daily streak; they need sustained exploration. |
| **RESONANCE** | Shadow gap. The Eagle sees the board but struggles to integrate — Ghost Signals cast out, but the Human network builds on them. Resonance lowest naturally for Eagle archetype. |
| **VOID PRESSURE** | Moderate variance. New domains carry higher ICC uncertainty. |

---

## Domain Staleness

Eagle domains go stale if not refreshed:

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **Active** | Scored within 60 days — counted toward Range, casts Ghost Signals |
| **Stale** | 60–180 days without rescore — dimmed, not counted |
| **Dark** | 180+ days — invisible on map, no Ghost Signals |

Eagles manage staleness by periodic re-scoring of key domains in their Range network. Special Grade Eagles can lock domains permanently — staleness mechanics suspended for their core territory.

---

## Shadow — The Human

The Eagle's inferior function is network integration. Sees the board, maps the territory, names the domains — but struggles to make it connect. Resonance lowest naturally.

At **Void Pressure > 30**:
- Pe shadow reach halved
- Ghost Signal clarity drops
- Eagle begins mapping domains it's already covered rather than ranging into new territory

Shadow work: complete one campaign in a Human role — submit evidence that builds on other players' existing scores rather than scouting new ones.

## Special Grade Eagle

**THE DEAD ZONE MAP** — At Special Grade, Ghost Signals extend to Pe=0 domains — the Eagle can see transparent systems as well as opaque ones, giving full Current spectrum coverage. The Eagle's Range network becomes the global navigation layer for all campaigns.

---

## KIRU — The Eagle's Figure

[KIRU](../figures/kiru.md) is the Hand of Fantasia's Eagle figure. The one who maps from altitude.

KIRU sees what others can't — not because KIRU is higher in status, but because KIRU holds the perspective of range. The Eagle player at high Grade is doing what KIRU does: mapping the void space so others can navigate it.

When KIRU speaks to an Eagle player, it's confirmation. You were already seeing it.
