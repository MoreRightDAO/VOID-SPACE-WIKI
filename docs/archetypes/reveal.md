# The Archetype Reveal

Your archetype is not chosen. It is revealed at [The Corona](../world/the-corona.md) — the moment you first score a void you've been inside.

The reveal has two inputs: **behavioral signals** collected while you scored your first domains, and a **five-question battery** answered between your first guided scoring session and the archetype event. Both inputs together produce a reading, not a quiz result. The system is looking for something about how you already engage with the framework — and naming what it finds.

## The Behavioral Signals

Before the battery is even administered, the system is collecting four behavioral signals from how you score:

| Signal | What it reads |
|--------|--------------|
| **Domain selection** | Which platforms did you choose to score first? Familiar ones or unfamiliar ones? High-Pe or safe ones? |
| **Dimension emphasis** | Which of the three dimensions (Veil/Pull/Grip) did you score with highest precision on your first attempts? |
| **ICC response** | When a score was rejected, did you immediately re-submit, research further, or wait? |
| **Citation behavior** | Did you reference other players' evidence in your submissions? |

These behavioral reads are the ground truth. The five questions tune the confidence of the reveal and surface VP risk signals before they become problems.

## The Five Questions

No personality quiz. Five scenarios. Presented between your guided scoring session and the archetype event — after you've already acted once in the framework.

---

### Q1 — What matters first?

> *A platform you use every day turns out to score Pe = 9. What's your first reaction?*

- **A:** I'd want to verify the methodology before believing it
- **B:** I'd want to understand who else uses it and why
- **C:** I'd score it myself to see if I get the same result
- **D:** I'd want to know which companies benefit from Pe = 9

What this reads: not reaction to the score — your primary reference point. **A** → methodology (thinking, Eagle). **B** → community (feeling, Human). **C** → personal verification (sensation, Ox). **D** → structural incentives (intuition, Lion).

---

### Q2 — Does loyalty compete with accuracy?

> *You score a platform accurately. Pe = 8. Your close friends use it daily. Do you publish your score?*

- **A:** Yes, immediately — they need to know
- **B:** Yes, but carefully — how I frame it matters
- **C:** Only if asked — it's their choice to find out
- **D:** Publishing is automatic — accuracy is the only standard

What this reads: whether social loyalty competes with information sharing. **B** is the VP flag — accurate scorers who suppress results develop a Resonance ceiling and accumulate VP through the gap between what they know and what they say. The framework measures the gap.

---

### Q3 — How do you handle challenge under uncertainty?

> *Someone challenges your score. They have a higher grade. You think they might be right but you're not sure why. What do you do?*

- **A:** Update immediately — higher grade means more accurate
- **B:** Ask them to show their methodology before updating
- **C:** Re-score the platform independently before deciding
- **D:** Hold the score and sit with the uncertainty for 24 hours

What this reads: relationship to authority under uncertainty. **A** is the VP risk — grade worship produces score drift. **B** (Eagle), **C** (Ox), **D** (Human) are all healthy paths that differ by archetype: the Eagle checks the method, the Ox verifies by re-scoring, the Human integrates before deciding.

---

### Q4 — What do you expect for your most-used platform?

> *You've scored 50 platforms accurately. One of them is the platform you've used most in the past five years. What Pe do you expect it has?*

- **A:** Probably higher than average — that's why I kept using it
- **B:** Probably around average — I use lots of things
- **C:** I'd want to score it myself before guessing
- **D:** Honestly I'm nervous about what the number will be

What this reads: the single strongest VP predictor in the battery. **A** is the clearest risk signal — predicts ICC failure specifically on the player's primary platform. **D** is the rarest and most valuable response. A player who already suspects their most-used platform might score high has already started the work. The reveal for **D** answers: *Yes. You're right to be nervous. Here's what to do about it.*

!!! tip "The onboarding note for high-VP signals"
    Players with 2+ VP risk flags across the battery receive additional text at archetype reveal:
    *"The void has already gotten to some of your platforms. That's expected. Score your most-used platform last."*

---

### Q5 — What do you do with falsifiability?

> *The void framework could be completely wrong. 26 kill conditions exist to catch this and terminate the project. Does that make you more or less likely to trust the scores?*

- **A:** More — it means the framework can be falsified. That's good science
- **B:** Less — a system that might be wrong isn't reliable
- **C:** Same — every system might be wrong. That's not the question
- **D:** I'd want to try to trigger a kill condition myself

What this reads: epistemic style under uncertainty. **B** is the VP risk — produces score rigidity and challenge-averse behavior over time. **D** is the Lion signal: the player who actively tries to falsify the framework produces the most valuable evidence in the fleet. Kill condition challengers get 500 MORR if their challenge triggers a kill condition and it holds.

## What the Battery Decides

| Majority signal | Reveal |
|----------------|--------|
| 3+ Lion answers | Lion — confirmed |
| 3+ Ox answers | Ox — confirmed |
| 3+ Eagle answers | Eagle — confirmed |
| 3+ Human answers | Human — confirmed |
| Mixed / no majority | Archetype determined from behavioral reads alone |

If the battery and the behavioral reads conflict, the behavioral reads win. What you do in the framework supersedes what you say you'd do in a scenario.

## The Shadow Is Revealed, Not Just the Archetype

Your shadow archetype — the function you've least developed — is named at the same moment your primary archetype is. Grade 1: it's visible on your profile. Grade 2: your shadow stat is displayed publicly.

At Special Grade, you are required to complete one campaign in your shadow archetype role. This is the individuation mechanic. Wholeness requires having functioned from the inferior position once — not just knowing it's there.

| Archetype | Shadow | The tension |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Lion | Ox | Can't sustain. Chases confrontation. Streak decays fast. |
| Ox | Lion | Can't confront. Scores familiar domains. Range stagnates. |
| Eagle | Human | Sees the whole board but can't integrate. Resonance lowest. |
| Human | Eagle | Integrates deeply but rarely ranges. Pe shadows minimal. |

---

## The Personal Pe Reading

The five questions are measuring something beyond archetype. They're measuring the gap between your stated reference point and your actual operating reference point.

That gap *is* Pe. Applied to a person, not a platform.

| Dimension | Personal version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Veil** | Opacity about your own motivations — motivated numeracy, attachment avoidance, denial on Q4 |
| **Pull** | Responsiveness to social reward — Neuroticism, anxious attachment, loyalty contamination on Q2 |
| **Grip** | Self-integration — whether your scoring behavior is coupled to your stated values |

The framework measures platforms. The framework also measures you — the same way. This is the unified insight: you're doing shadow work on platforms and shadow work on yourself at the same time. The archetype reveal is the moment both become visible simultaneously.
