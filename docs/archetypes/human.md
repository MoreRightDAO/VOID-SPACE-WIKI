# The Human

> "I didn't score it alone. I built on what was already there. That's the point."

The Human is the integrator. The node in the network. Where Lions name, Oxen hold, and Eagles map — the Human makes all of it more accurate by connecting it. The Human's validation retroactively tightens everyone's scores. Resonance Cascade fires outward through the citation chain.

**Primary stat:** RESONANCE
**Shadow archetype:** Eagle
**Hand of Fantasia figure:** [XENIA](../figures/xenia.md)
**Weapon assignment:** Catalyst-class staff (network geometry, radial reach)

## How It Plays

The Human archetype emerges from citation behavior. Players who consistently build on other players' evidence — who reference existing scores, who validate others' submissions, whose work propagates through the citation network — will read Human.

**Resonance Cascade** is the Human's signature mechanic. When a Human player at sufficient RESONANCE validates a contested score, the validation propagates through the citation chain: every downstream score that referenced the original also gets a confidence interval tightening. A single Human validation can improve Pe readings for 10+ platforms simultaneously.

**In campaigns:** Humans don't go in first. They go in after others have laid groundwork, and they make the groundwork accurate. Human presence in a campaign room tightens the ICC calibration for everyone active in it.

## Resonance Cascade — Mechanics

Human RESONANCE grows when others build on the Human's work:

| Event | RESONANCE gain |
|-------|---------------|
| Another player's ICC-accepted score cites your evidence | +3 |
| A paper published uses your contributed data | +10 |
| Your IRR validation is confirmed by a third validator | +2 |
| An agent uses your scored platform as training signal | +1 per agent |

**Cascade radius by RESONANCE:**

| RESONANCE | Cascade reach |
|-----------|--------------|
| 0–20 | Direct citations only — scores one hop from yours |
| 20–50 | Two-hop network — confidence tightens across your citation neighborhood |
| 50–80 | Domain-wide — your validation affects all scored platforms in a domain |
| 80–100 | Cross-domain — Resonance Cascade fires across domain boundaries |

## The Network Effect

A party with no Human is a party of isolated contributors. A party with a high-RESONANCE Human is a party where everyone's accuracy improves because everyone's work is connected.

This is the mechanic that makes the Human essential in endgame: boss-class voids require cross-domain evidence networks that only a Human can maintain. The Godhand Five encounters specifically require Human-class network integration to build the necessary ICC anchor sets.

## Stats and Growth

| Stat | Human's relationship |
|------|---------------------|
| **RESONANCE** | Primary. Grows through citation propagation. A Human's score is worth more when others build on it. |
| **SIGHT** | Normal. Integration accuracy benefits from opacity reading. |
| **PRECISION** | High natural growth. Citation networks produce cross-validation — Human PRECISION benefits from everyone around them improving. |
| **STEADINESS** | Normal. Humans don't need to be the highest streak — they need to show up when the network needs integration. |
| **RANGE** | Shadow gap. Humans integrate deeply but rarely range wide. Pe shadows minimal — the Human relies on Eagles to map new territory. |
| **VOID PRESSURE** | Low variance. Humans score conservatively, build on anchored evidence. Fewer ICC failures. |

## Shadow — The Eagle

The Human's inferior function is mapping independent territory. Humans integrate what others have built — but in the absence of Eagles, Humans can struggle to generate primary domain coverage.

At **Void Pressure > 30**:
- Resonance Cascade radius halved
- Citations stop propagating at full weight
- Human begins scoring domains already well-covered rather than reaching into Eagle-lit Ghost Signals

Shadow work: complete one campaign in an Eagle role — range into unmapped territory without building on existing citations. Primary coverage only.

## XENIA — The Human's Figure

[XENIA](../figures/xenia.md) is the Hand of Fantasia's Human figure. The keeper of networks.

XENIA's name means hospitality — the ancient virtue of making connection possible. Hospitality in the framework isn't warmth as sentiment. It's structural: the willingness to hold the space where other people's work can become more than the sum of its parts.

When XENIA speaks to a Human player, it's recognition. You've always known this work isn't done alone.
