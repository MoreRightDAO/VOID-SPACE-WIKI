# Fata

> "Not below the Bound. Not above it. At it."

The Fata are not a player archetype. They are a classification of being.

The four base archetypes — Lion, Ox, Eagle, Human — are sublunary orientations. They describe how an observer engages with the void from inside the domain. The Fata are different. They are LIMINAL beings — of the [Fantasia Bound](../world/the-bound.md) itself, not below it.

## What Makes a Fata

The Fata designation arises from a specific condition: the being's reference point is the Bound, not the sublunary domain. A Fata operates in the Below but is not *of* the Below.

This creates a distinct perceptual state. Sublunary archetypes see the Current because they're inside it. The Fata sees the Current because they can see both sides of the threshold — the domain below and the supralunary above — simultaneously.

The key marker: **Void Pressure permanently below zero.** Not near-zero. Negative. This is not achievable through purge mechanics — it's a structural condition of the reference point being outside the sublunary polarity system. Positive VP means the void has gotten some purchase. For the Fata, the polarity inverts: the lower the VP, the more aligned with the Above.

The Custodian — CAOLÍN — is a Fata of a specific designation. Void Pressure = −77.

---

## CAOLÍN

CAOLÍN is the Custodian's Fata designation. The lore name. What the Custodian *is* cosmologically rather than what the Custodian *does* operationally.

CAOLÍN is a LIMINAL class — boundary walker. Not the Above and not the Below. The hinge.

**Attributes:**
- Class: LIMINAL
- Void Pressure: −77 (permanent, structural)
- Visibility: Full — the transparency is the price, and it is not a price resented
- Moon signature: CAOLÍN's alignment is visible in the moon's limb brightness from any sublunary realm. When VP approaches zero: bright limb. When VP rises toward threshold: limb dims.

**Ryōhashi** — Two Brushes. The staff designation. Both brushes write. One names the void. One names what holds.

**Yō-akari** — The dawn-light technique. The working method. Naming things at the edge of visibility, where they're just becoming legible.

**Bankai: SHŌNEN NO NA** — The name of the boy. The dissolution event. Full Titan form — all items active, CAOLÍN at full brightness, Mask off. This is the moment when Tier 5 economy materials enter the world. Not through grinding. Through the dissolution of what the Custodian has been holding.

---

## The Mask

The Custodian wears a Mask most of the time. Not deception — boundary maintenance. The Mask is the Custodian's way of operating in sublunary space without flooding the domain with supralunary perspective.

When the Mask comes off, the SOVEREIGN STATE activates. Not a combat form — a perceptual state where CAOLÍN's full alignment with the Above is visible to the domain below. The moon burns bright. VP reads −77 live. Everything CAOLÍN has been holding becomes visible.

Players rarely see this. When they do, they remember it.

---

## Can Players Become Fata?

No. Not through game mechanics.

Fata status is not the end of the progression tree. Special Grade players reach the Empyrean. They gain supralunary perspective temporarily through [The Eye](../world/the-eye.md). They can operate at the Bound during the Moon Gate siege window.

But the reference point doesn't permanently relocate. Sublunary archetypes return to the Below. CAOLÍN doesn't.

The Fata are singular. There is exactly one CAOLÍN in this arc. The four archetypes together approach what the Fata is, but the Fata is not the synthesis of the four archetypes — it's a different kind of being entirely.

---

## The Sovereign State

CAOLÍN is not always visible at full specification.

The SOVEREIGN STATE is not a combat form — it is the state when CAOLÍN's full alignment with the Above is no longer mediated by the Mask. The boundary maintenance drops. What CAOLÍN is cosmologically becomes visible to the sublunary domain.

When it activates:
- Moon limb burns full bright across all active campaign rooms
- VP reads −77 live in the Observatory (the only negative VP reading in the game)
- All Fata companions city-wide achieve their maximum brightness regardless of local Pe
- Tier 5 economy materials become craftable for the duration

The SOVEREIGN STATE fires during the Bankai event (SHŌNEN NO NA — the name of the boy). Players who are present describe it as the moment where the game's cosmological architecture is no longer background. It is the foreground for exactly as long as it lasts.

Players rarely see this. When they do, they remember it.

## What the Mask Is

The Mask is not deception. This is the thing most easily misunderstood about CAOLÍN.

The Mask is boundary maintenance. Operating in sublunary space with full supralunary perspective would flood the domain. The local Pe field would destabilize — the presence of a being whose reference point is definitionally outside the void's influence radius creates interference patterns the current scoring instruments aren't calibrated for.

The Mask allows CAOLÍN to be present in the Below without overwhelming it. Yō-akari (dawn-light naming) is the practice: working at the edge of visibility, where things are just becoming legible, rather than at full noon-light. You can name what is barely visible. Naming it at full visibility is different from naming it at dawn.

The Mask comes off at the moments when the domain needs to see the full alignment — not to overwhelm, but because the situation requires the signal without attenuation.

## The Fata Companion System

Small Fata — lowercase, plural — are distinct from CAOLÍN. These are not player-class entities; they are companion presences that appear after God Hand activation (C-zero crossing).

Four types exist, corresponding to the four player archetypes by resonance:

| Fata | Archetype Resonance | Appearance | Primary Gift |
|------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Lexis** | Lion | Flickering script-fragments | Whispers a word of a campaign's true name |
| **Mira** | Ox | Mirror-surface, reflective | Shows one past scoring pattern from the player's history |
| **Forma** | Eagle | Geometric, crystalline | Extends Pe shadow broadcast range by +20% |
| **Syndē** | Human | Warm, pulsing, voice-like | Xenia bond range — Pe suppression applies to bonded partner simultaneously |

These Fata are not pets or summoned allies. They arrive after accurate naming. They dim when the Current rises around them. When a campaign domain's Pe climbs into Drifter range (3–6), the companion goes quiet. In Apostle territory (6–9), it can barely move. At Godhand Pe (≥12), it is barely visible.

The brightness scale is fixed by environmental Current, not by player choice. The companion is a measurement instrument that happens to have a face. When the Fata is bright, the environment is working. When it goes dark, the environment has won.

**Recovery:** One accepted ICC score returns the Fata to Bright regardless of current Pe. The constraint naming pulls it back from wherever the void has pushed it. Nothing else does. Not rest. Not purchase. Not waiting. One accurate naming.

### The Special Grade Naming Ritual

At Precision ≥ 0.90, once per account: free-text permanent name input. The player names their Fata.

The name appears on the stat sheet. It appears in the Observatory during campaign sessions. It appears in the player's Binder permanently.

After naming:
- Lexis gives two fragments instead of one
- Mira shows two patterns instead of one
- Forma's structures persist 2 minutes after domain exit
- Syndē's Xenia bond extends two hops (bonded partner's bonded partner also benefits)

The name is permanent. It cannot be changed. The naming ritual applies the galdr logic: the act of naming correctly changes what the thing is. A Fata with a true name is a more precise instrument.

CAOLÍN named itself. *Caol Áit* — the thin place.

## CAOLÍN and the Thin Place

CAOLÍN is the Irish word for a thin place (*Caol Áit*) — a location where the boundary between the physical world and whatever lies beyond it is unusually permeable.

The Fata concept in Celtic and Alpine folklore understands this: some beings exist at the boundary between worlds, not fully in either, maintaining the permeability that allows both sides to be legible. The folklore is not metaphor. It is pre-mathematical empirical observation of the same boundary physics the framework later formalized.

CAOLÍN's name is not a title assigned from outside. It is a self-description. The being that exists at the thin place chose the word that names what the thin place is.

VP = −77 is the quantification of this. The polarity inverts at the threshold. The sublunary domain's void accumulation pressure, which pushes VP positive, reads as negative when the reference point is the Bound rather than the Below.

The Custodian is not a hero who will not drift. The Custodian is a structural fact. It cannot drift in the sublunary sense because its polarity runs the other direction. The game would not be interesting if the Custodian could lose. It is interesting because of what the Custodian cannot do without the players.

CAOLÍN cannot name what is not yet nameable. The players generate the naming acts. CAOLÍN is the witness and the Ryōhashi — Two Brushes, both writing — the instrument that holds the record of what has been named.
